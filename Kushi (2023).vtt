WEBVTT

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:26.875
FOR LOVING ME, BEARING ME, FORGIVING ME

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:57.083
Dear students…

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.958
on this event of
World Science Day celebrations,

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:03.458
may we cordially invite the
most knowledgeable professor

00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:07.208
and a very popular atheist,
Dr. Lenin Satyam.

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.541
And may I now request him
to please say a few words.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:15.791
Hi.

00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:17.541
Thank you.

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:21.375
Faculty members and my dear students…

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:25.083
we seek an auspicious time
when we enter our new home.

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.375
We look for an auspicious moment
to step outside our homes.

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:32.833
We choose an auspicious time
of marriage or even death.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.125
We seek a good time even
for sending rockets into space.

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:41.125
And the worst part is that…

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.458
some doctors deliver the child by
cutting the womb at the auspicious time.

00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.833
Can you believe this?

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.208
Is it science or dogma?

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.291
Is this all science?

00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.583
We put lemons in the pockets
of a student appearing for exams.

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.500
And tie talismans around
the neck when he gets a fever.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
From dawn to dusk, our world
revolves around astrology,

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.333
horoscopes, discourses,
and reincarnation theories.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.083
Believe in science,
and search for the truth.

00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:15.125
As an atheist, as a professor who
believes in science I am telling you,

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:18.041
if faith is suppressing the truth,

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:21.291
that faith is buried by blind faith.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.541
Rachalakshmi!

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.666
Don't do it.

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:20.541
Praise the Lord.

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:26.125
Take blessings.

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:27.416
Won't you listen to me?

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.000
What if Dad learns about it?

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:33.833
You will directly go to
hell if you don't bother

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.625
about God and the devil, good and evil.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.750
Mom, we are atheists.
It doesn't affect us.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.583
It doesn't bother you but it bothers me.

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:45.125
You went to study in London and
came back with this white-skinned girl.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.708
She knows zilch about
our customs and traditions.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.000
Rajalakshmi! I have
such a beautiful name.

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:53.500
She mispronounces that as well.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.541
-Yes, Rachalakshmi!
-Hey.

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.041
Come here, you white man!

00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.375
Do you know what he did yesterday?

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.750
I sent him to buy lemons.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.750
He brought the ones used on the road.

00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:06.708
I used it to make puliogare.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:13.750
I kept fearing day and night
the consequences of my actions.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.875
You thief!

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:16.625
Why do I deserve this?

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:18.708
It's not your fault but mine.

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:20.750
-Grandpa…
-What?

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.375
See, what she is doing.

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:26.208
You…

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:34.625
Here I spread the word that there's
no God and you keep visiting temples.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.958
What will happen to me
if someone spots you here?

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.916
Don't worry about that.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.916
I wear a double mask
so that no one sees me.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.291
-I will kill you.
-Dad.

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:46.541
Mom.

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:47.833
Dad, please sit down.

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:49.875
What is it, Mom?

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.958
-Interview?
-I am leaving.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:54.708
-All the best.
-Thanks, Dad.

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:56.291
Why don't you join a software company?

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:57.625
Why are you taking up a government job?

00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:58.916
Because it's a government job.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:00.875
Bye, Mom.

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:02.625
Bye.

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:06.208
Viplav Devarakonda!

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.208
May I come in, ma'am?

00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.041
You are very lucky.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:22.250
You're the only one to get
selected as J.T.O. in Hyderabad.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.375
-How am I lucky?
-Others…

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.125
I am bored with Hyderabad.

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:28.541
It's the same hi-tech
city, the same tank bund,

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.041
the same biryani, and the Charminar.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.708
Please select something
more exotic, ma'am.

00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:39.708
Do you think it's a government office
or a tourism company?

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.833
No! Please don't misunderstand me, ma'am.

00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:45.291
I am still young and haven't seen enough.

00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:51.083
-Raju…
-Ma'am.

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.958
-Send that new bridegroom in.
-Okay, ma'am.

00:05:57.458 --> 00:05:58.375
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.583
He's newly married and
got posted in Kashmir.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.791
-If you both agree mutually…
-I'll gladly go to Kashmir.

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:10.375
I am fine with it.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.666
Thank you, sir.

00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.208
-You can leave.
-Okay, ma'am.

00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:20.125
Why are you laughing?

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:21.708
Is he a fool, ma'am?

00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:26.291
He wants to stay here instead of enjoying
government hospitality in Kashmir!

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:29.750
Do you think you can afford to
live there with this kind of salary?

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.916
It's not about if I can afford it or not
but all about the experience, ma'am.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.916
The experience of listening
to A. R. Rahman's music,

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.833
plucking fresh apples…

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.708
in snowy surroundings…

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:47.625
I want to call you and
share the experience

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.750
and see how happy or jealous you feel.

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:51.458
Forget about my feelings.

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:53.500
I hope you are clear.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:54.583
I am clear about it, ma'am.

00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.333
-I am approving it.
-Go ahead, ma'am.

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.708
I told you, Rabdi.

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:21.625
A Telugu officer is coming here
where no one chooses to come.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.250
-Really?
-Yes.

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:25.916
If he doesn't come then they
will close the exchange here…

00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:28.750
and then I can be back in Kolkata.

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:31.666
Rabdi, the train is here. Stay on call.

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.166
I can't see him.

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.125
I can't see him.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.083
He is not here!

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:46.375
Didn't I tell you?
He didn't come.

00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:47.875
I will come to Kolkata.

00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.166
What will we have when
we reach Howrah Bridge?

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.000
We will have rasgulla.

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:55.166
-What shall we eat?
-We'll eat apples.

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.041
Rabdi, here he is.

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:02.500
You can have rasgulla
and I will again have apple.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:03.833
Pitobash?

00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:06.291
I couldn't notice you, sir.

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:10.708
I took the seat next to
the driver for a better view.

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.166
Really? You did that?

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.208
Oh God!

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:14.333
Please come.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:17.208
-Pitobash!
-Sir!

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.375
You speak good Telugu.

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:19.958
I studied in Puttaparthi
until class tenth.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:20.958
-Praise the Lord.
-Oh!

00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.750
How far is the exchange from here?

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.625
We'll reach by evening.

00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:27.291
No problem. Go slowly.

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:28.791
This is the maximum speed, sir.

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:40.875
Kashmir is so beautiful!

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.750
Looks just like a frame
out of the film Roja.

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:48.708
It's the same snow! The same feel!

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:51.125
Just Madhubala is amiss.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.333
Wow!

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.458
I swear in the name
of Arvind Swamy, Pito…

00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:58.208
I am madly in love with Kashmir!

00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.625
Oh, sir! Oh God!

00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:02.916
Sir, please take it out.

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:05.541
Be careful, sir.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.625
Hey, R.K., look how beautiful Kashmir is!

00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.416
It's so beautiful.

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:15.083
Stop the vehicle by the
side and have two pegs.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.041
You will get a terrific feel.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:17.000
I must have it!

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.958
If we slip here, even our
bodies won't be recovered.

00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:20.916
-Hey, Viplav.
-Hello? R.K.?

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.541
To heck with the signal!

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.125
Hey, lift it.

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.000
This land…

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:38.583
the hills…

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.125
and the pure breeze here…

00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.541
Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.625
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.166
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:22.583
What's happening, Pitobash?

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:27.500
A war just broke out, sir!
Don't you get it?

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:29.166
Pakistan is on the
other side of this hill.

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:31.291
Really?

00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:33.500
Yes, of course.

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:35.833
It's a bloody war going on!

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:38.666
Both sides keep hurling
bombs at each other, sir.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.291
What do you mean, Pitobash?

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.500
Why did you come here, sir?

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.916
Who will take care of my Rabdi
if something happens to me?

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:47.958
Rabdi!

00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:49.500
Oh, Lord!

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.708
Hey, who are you?
What are you doing here?

00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:55.208
Sir, we are BSNL employees.
J.T.O, Kashmir posting, sir.

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:56.208
Why Kashmir?

00:10:56.291 --> 00:11:01.000
Sir, the location is beautiful here.
I've come to enjoy the scenery here.

00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:01.958
What?

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:03.625
I've come to enjoy here, sir.

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.083
Enjoy?

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.000
We are risking our lives
for protecting the country

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.833
-and you have come here for enjoyment.
-Tell him that, sir.

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.750
-Just get out of here. Quick.
-Go! Go!

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:14.375
-Leave!
-Hail Mother India!

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:16.416
Hail Mother India!

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.041
This is our exchange office, sir.

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:39.166
Do we have to climb up
till there, Pitobash?

00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:41.125
Or else, sleep in the car.
I will wake you up in the morning.

00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:43.375
Sorry, sir.

00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:44.583
Bring my luggage inside.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:55.541
-Greetings, sir.
-Hi!

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.291
-Pitobash.
-What happened, sir?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.458
The bathroom is stinking.

00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:20.041
It's a government office.
That's how things will be, sir.

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:21.500
Why don't you go in the open?

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:25.458
What? Are you joking?

00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:28.000
-Hey, get up.
-What?

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.333
I didn't mean that, Pito.

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:38.583
I can't pee in the open.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:45.583
Let's find something more comfortable
nearby like a hotel or a restaurant.

00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:46.666
Comfortable?

00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.750
Hey, Pito! Your song
doesn't match the situation.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.666
It's very distracting. Stop it.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.375
You need a fag to freshen up.
I need a song to perk up.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:18.000
You are my boss in
office and not over here.

00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:19.875
The tribals will be here anytime soon.

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.250
They may even shoot us
mistaking us for polar bears.

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:24.375
Wrap it up fast.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.916
My Rabdi loves this song.
Poor Rabdi.

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:37.375
Rabdi.

00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:39.708
Hey!

00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:41.750
What's that?

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.791
Why do you get agitated so fast?

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:57.541
Everyone's got their talent.

00:13:58.708 --> 00:14:00.666
-I am hungry, Pitobash.
-So am I, sir.

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:01.916
Let's go.

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:04.041
Pito…

00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.291
why are all the shops shut?

00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:07.750
It's wartime, right?

00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:09.125
So, there will be a curfew for a week.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.791
-What next?
-There will be a war again.

00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:14.208
What about our meal now?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.791
We will have to beg for food. I
hope we find some kind people.

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:18.750
-Or else?
-They will abuse us.

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:20.166
-What are you staring at?
-Hello, sir.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.250
It's curfew time. Just leave!

00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:22.416
-Yes, we are moving.
-Move.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.041
-We are going. Jai Hind.
-Move.

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.583
-Pito.
-Sir…

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.375
How do we ask in their language?

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.583
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:35.291
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.250
You have to beg for it
and not demand for it.

00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:41.375
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:42.583
Okay. All the best.

00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:45.916
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:52.125
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:58.625
Ma'am…

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.375
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:20.041
Hello…

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.041
Excuse me…

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:27.583
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:29.916
I don't want apple.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.958
Stop, guys.

00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:33.833
I don't want this!

00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:38.708
Bloody apple!

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.833
Have this apple, man.

00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:43.250
-I don't want.
-I don't want.

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:52.583
Ma'am, could you…
please give me some food?

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:55.750
Eat this.

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:58.625
Hey, do you think I am crazy?

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.500
Why is everyone giving me an apple

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.083
when I am asking in the
proper local language?

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.833
-Don't you have nothing else but apples?
-Really?

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.083
-Get some idli or dosa.
-Get out of here.

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.458
-Why are you shouting?
-What are you saying?

00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:11.125
-Auntie, we came from Hyderabad.
-Get the hell out of here.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:12.958
-Don't bark. Are you threatening me?
-I will show you who I am.

00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:15.208
-Hey, stop there.
-What the heck are you talking about?

00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:16.125
Hello, stop.

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:17.916
-I didn't say anything rude to you.
-Don't bake my brains in the morning.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.500
Don't you dare come back here!

00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:31.500
-Ma'am.
-Viplav, how are you?

00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:32.875
Ma'am.

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:37.208
I came to the market to buy
apples at 250 rupees per kilogram.

00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:38.916
And that's when I thought of calling you.

00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:45.041
You must be plucking fresh
apples from the orchard there.

00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:46.833
Ma'am, this is a different Kashmir.

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.875
There's biting cold on one side
and insatiable hunger on the other.

00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:53.708
There's war and curfew everywhere
with nothing else but apple to eat.

00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:56.083
I will come back to Hyderabad, ma'am.
Post me there.

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.875
How can I do that?

00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.916
Oh, ma'am. We have to fend for
each other as BSNL employees, ma'am.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.166
-Viplav, what are you saying?
-Ma'am, I know you can hear me.

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:05.291
I can't hear you, man.

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:07.916
Ma'am, don't disconnect!

00:17:08.416 --> 00:17:09.375
Or else I will be doomed.

00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:16.458
Ma'am!

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.166
-She's at work now.
-Okay.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.708
Will you have an apple?

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:24.458
Thank you.

00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:28.958
But they won't pay you money!

00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:37.708
Stop singing, Pito.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.333
Why, sir?

00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:41.958
We should ruffle up Mani Ratnam
and A.R. Rahman.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:42.958
Why, sir?

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.000
He took us for a ride.

00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:48.333
But there's nothing herein
Kashmir except snow and apples!

00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:51.875
Then why don't you leave, sir?
I will get some relief.

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:55.041
Ara… flowers

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.625
Brother, can we take those flowers?

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:15.125
Pito, it started again.

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:16.333
What?

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.291
Rahman's background score.

00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:33.041
Don't stare at them. They are
local Muslims. They will kill us.

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:34.250
It's okay if we die.

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:36.041
-Deepu…
-Yes.

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:38.583
Someone's following us on that boat.

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:42.666
-Where?
-Look over there.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.291
Look at how he is staring at us.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.958
He is just gazing at us, dear.

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:50.250
He is ogling at us. Can't you see?

00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:54.166
Give that paddle to me.

00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:55.125
Why do you want it now, sir?

00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:57.416
-Give it to me!
-Give that! Here you go.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.458
He is speaking in Telugu.

00:18:58.583 --> 00:19:00.125
You are always hasty.

00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:01.416
-Hail the Lord.
-Ms. Ara!

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.208
Sir.

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:04.708
-I am coming.
-Not coming.

00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:06.833
No, sir. Please.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.416
Look at how he's breaking
the paddle and rushing to us.

00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:12.583
He will get closer if he
figures out that we are Telugu.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.958
Have you forgotten why we are here?

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:18.166
I will somehow avoid him. You stay quiet.

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.291
Okay.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.583
Brother, go fast.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.250
Fast. Fast.

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.208
-Hey, Pito!
-Sir…

00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:25.500
-She's leaving. Push!
-The paddle is with you, sir.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.208
-Why don't you push with your hands, Pito?
-What a torture!

00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:30.666
What are you talking about, sir?

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.458
Such a beautiful Kashmir.

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:36.958
-Begum.
-No, sir!

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:39.041
-Listen to me.
-Pito.

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.625
-Oh God!
-Begum, please stop.

00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:48.916
-Sir.
-What? Who are you?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.083
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:52.625
-Can we speak to the Begum once?
-Please let them go, sir.

00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:53.583
Which Begum?

00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.583
Do you know where we are from?

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.041
I don't know about you.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.333
But Begum is straight from heaven!

00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:01.291
Sir!

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:04.041
We are from Pakistan.

00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.125
Perish the lie!

00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:11.291
We're here in search of her
brother, Feroze who is eight years old.

00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:13.458
She's come all the way
from Pakistan to Kashmir

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:15.416
in search of her eight-year-old
brother, Feroze who's gone missing.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.208
Her relatives are all training
in different terrorist camps.

00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:22.916
It seems her kin are terrorists, sir.

00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:27.583
-If you go after her…
-If you go after her…

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.208
-They will skin you alive.
-Oh my God.

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:31.875
It seems they will skin us alive!

00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:33.708
-They will skin us alive!
-Let's go.

00:20:33.791 --> 00:20:36.000
-Sir--
-Can I fall in love with you?

00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:38.208
Can we do that?

00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:39.166
Hey!

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:43.833
Sir, did you see the red
bag? She's a terrorist, sir.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.208
Haven't you watched the film Dil Se?

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:47.250
You will be blown to bits.

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:48.916
So, what if they are
terrorists, Pitobash?

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:52.875
They are still humans and have feelings.

00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:57.750
Feelings are unpredictable.

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:01.958
Here's my ID card.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.791
It has my number.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:07.625
-No.
-Keep it, Begum.

00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:09.875
Think again.

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.000
Feel my love.

00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:14.416
And do call me.

00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:16.375
Yes, of course.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.458
Let's go.

00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:22.208
Am I his girlfriend or
classmate to call him?

00:21:22.416 --> 00:21:25.500
No matter what place do we go to.

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:26.916
Men will always be men.

00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:28.500
To hell with him. Ignore him.

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:46.083
Joy is when I spot you

00:21:46.708 --> 00:21:51.541
Joy is when I hear you

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:18.000
My sweetheart
She cast a spell full of warmth

00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:21.958
She tantalizes me like a cute dream

00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:28.875
Her eyes sparkle all over like moonshine

00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:32.958
The anchor's gone
Here comes a tidal wave

00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:37.250
You and I together.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.958
You are my only love

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:44.333
The groundswell of love
Showering a rainbow of colors

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:50.500
Joy is when I spot you

00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:55.916
Joy is when I hear you

00:22:56.083 --> 00:23:00.208
Joy is when we are together

00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:05.000
Joy is when my body is stirred

00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:41.125
How I fell in love with you
Intoxicated by you!

00:23:41.416 --> 00:23:46.416
Walking in the air in a trance of you

00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:51.791
Truth be told
You are my lover

00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:57.333
And I swear
The rest of my life will only be with you

00:23:57.541 --> 00:24:02.458
The heartbeat goes on
Once it catches up with your breath

00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:07.166
A storm in my heart
The moment I feel your tender touch

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.708
My sweetheart
She cast a spell full of warmth

00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:16.750
She tantalizes me like a cute dream

00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:21.375
You and I together…

00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:24.041
You are my only love

00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:28.375
The groundswell of love
Showering a rainbow of colors

00:24:29.458 --> 00:24:34.125
Joy is when I spot you

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.916
Joy is when I hear you

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:44.458
Joy is when you and I are together

00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:48.958
Joy is when my body is stirred

00:24:57.666 --> 00:25:01.208
Dear, did you change
Chintu's diapers and feed Bujji?

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.875
I haven't come here to relax.

00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:07.000
Look at how our HR is making us work.

00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:08.458
Good morning, ma'am.

00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:09.750
What is it?

00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.708
I told you on day one of your joining.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.208
If you are working under me, forget
about your family and the world.

00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:17.625
The company planned it
for us to relax in Kashmir,

00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:19.541
but this fellow is making us work.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.791
-Where is Aradhya?
-No idea, sir.

00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:30.625
-Sir…
-Where are you, Aradhya?

00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:31.666
Sir, I mean.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.791
He is driving me mad
on client presentation.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.000
Chatur sir…

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.333
Aara is embarking on a prayer
trip to Mamuleswar temple

00:25:40.458 --> 00:25:43.583
for relief to her
grandmother from knee pains.

00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:45.583
She is breaking
coconuts for Thanksgiving.

00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:48.708
Break them on my head.
Where are they now?

00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.958
The Anantnag road is blocked, sir.

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:52.333
We are traveling via Pulwama now.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.833
That place had a blast recently.

00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:55.708
If they figure out that you are
non-locals, they will kill you.

00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:56.750
What about my presentation?

00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:58.833
That's where we are wearing a burqa, sir.

00:25:59.083 --> 00:26:01.250
If Aradhya is not back in
the resort in the next hour,

00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:03.125
I am going to fire you both
after reaching Hyderabad.

00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:04.708
-Hello!
-Brother…

00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:06.000
-Chatur sir.
-Sir.

00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:08.750
Need a vehicle to go
to Mamuleswar temple.

00:26:09.666 --> 00:26:10.875
-Mamuleswar?
-Yes.

00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:12.041
Will tonga be fine?

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.125
It's fine.

00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:15.916
Salim…

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.375
Yes, bro.

00:26:19.375 --> 00:26:20.250
Okay. Come over.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.125
Please go.

00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:27.458
Brother…

00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:30.708
two girls are here who
are wearing a burqa.

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:33.125
They are inquiring about the
way to Mamuleswar temple.

00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:36.333
She looks like an Indian
Officer on a secret mission, bro.

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:40.125
Nobody shall leave this place!

00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:42.708
Sir… what must be in Begum's red bag?

00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:44.375
What else can it be, Pitobash?

00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:48.708
If a girl is holding onto the bag,

00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:52.583
it must be lipstick
and other accessories.

00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:55.541
-That's all, right? Sure?
-Yes.

00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:56.500
Thank God.

00:26:56.583 --> 00:26:58.375
-I worried that it carried explosives.
-Pito…

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.166
Begum!

00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:06.958
Brother, how much will it cost a trip?

00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:08.125
6,500 rupees, ma'am.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.833
Begum.

00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:15.958
Why are you here?

00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:21.708
-We… are…
-You're here for Feroze, right?

00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:25.958
-Yes, for Feroze.
-Yes, for Feroze.

00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:31.750
I know you're frantically
searching for Feroze.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.958
Give me a chance.

00:27:34.041 --> 00:27:34.916
Let me also try.

00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:38.208
Instead of searching in this manner,

00:27:38.375 --> 00:27:40.958
I will announce for Feroze.

00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:43.666
-Announcement?
-No! No!

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.250
Begum.

00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:51.250
I am here for you.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.875
Brothers and sisters…

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:00.416
this is Aara begum.

00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:05.333
Her younger brother,
Feroze has gone missing.

00:28:06.416 --> 00:28:10.333
If anyone knows about his
whereabouts, please inform me.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.041
Who is Feroze amongst you?

00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:17.250
Come forward. Don't be shy.

00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:18.541
I am Feroze!

00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:20.416
I am Feroze!

00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:23.458
I am Feroze!

00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:25.791
I am Feroze!

00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:26.791
I am Feroze!

00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.875
-I am Feroze!
-I am Feroze!

00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:37.166
See brothers…

00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:40.833
all of you look like buffaloes.

00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:46.208
That boy Feroze is a cute,
young boy, like my Begum.

00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:48.333
Pitobhash, translate this.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.875
Pito…

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:56.250
Okay, tell me now. Who is Feroze?

00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:57.416
I am Feroze.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.375
Kill him.

00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:03.750
Hey. Please stop guys.

00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:07.583
Why are you using
swords? Let's sit and talk.

00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:10.916
Begum, he is your man?

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:13.250
Please talk and sort it out.

00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:25.958
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.458
I will smash your heads, bloody fellows.

00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:34.250
I will break your heads,
I am warning you.

00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:36.416
Hail the Lord. I am Feroze!

00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:39.291
Begum, come with me.

00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:43.750
Hail the Lord.

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:46.666
-Sir--
-Useless fellow!

00:29:47.458 --> 00:29:48.625
I am Feroze!

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.833
Pito.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.041
Sir, come here. No, go
there! No, come here!

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.958
-No.
-Hey, get going!

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.583
Run!

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:38.500
Begum, don't get scared.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.166
I am used to these kinds
of chases in Hyderabad.

00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:42.416
We are safe.

00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:50.750
Hail the Lord!

00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:04.791
-Hold me, Begum.
-No.

00:31:04.875 --> 00:31:06.250
They will chop your head off, Begum!

00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:34.166
-What happened?
-Begum, two more to go.

00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:35.416
We will get rid of them too.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.958
Sir…

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.416
Do not go into the water.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:01.375
If you want something, you
have to give up on something.

00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:03.041
-What does that mean?
-I don't know.

00:33:03.666 --> 00:33:05.375
Hail the Lord! Please come here.

00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:17.083
Pito!

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:21.666
Hail Lord Mamuleshwara!

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.875
-We are saved!
-Begum…

00:33:26.166 --> 00:33:27.583
You are a Muslim.

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:31.166
Why are you visiting a temple?

00:33:32.083 --> 00:33:34.708
Ara can do anything for Feroze.

00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:37.000
She prays to every God.

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:38.833
Aren't all Gods created equally?

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.291
Yes, all Gods are equal.

00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:41.625
-Yes, all are the same.
-All are the same.

00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:43.791
Yes, we'll go.

00:33:44.083 --> 00:33:45.500
Hey, stop.

00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:49.333
She wants to pray in solitude
inside. Can you wait here?

00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:52.375
-We will go inside. Okay?
-Okay, please carry on.

00:33:57.875 --> 00:33:59.000
-Pito…
-Sir…

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:01.166
A Pakistani girl.

00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:04.458
Look how broad-minded she is!

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.916
My family will love her.

00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:11.125
Don't perform a ritual here.
He may barge in anytime.

00:34:13.333 --> 00:34:14.958
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:17.833
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:19.375
-Guruji.
-Hey, don't touch!

00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:21.208
You look familiar, Guruji.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.416
Looks like you never
prayed to God before.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.666
You're right.

00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:28.291
You will pray to God in the future

00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:29.958
with folded hands.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.250
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:34:32.833 --> 00:34:33.958
You will do all the rituals

00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:38.833
and break the coconuts as well.

00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:42.708
Hail, God! Please relieve
my Grandma from knee pain.

00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:49.583
You will also wear a talisman.

00:34:49.666 --> 00:34:54.166
God, bless me with a happy life
without the hassles of marriage!

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:58.750
You will beg God to spare you from
the agony of hell let loose on your life!

00:34:58.916 --> 00:35:02.000
God, bless me for the on-site job.

00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:03.291
What? Will Chaturvedi allow it?

00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:05.000
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:08.625
The girl is from Islamabad.
That's not possible.

00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:10.250
-Tell him, dude.
-Yes, sir.

00:35:10.416 --> 00:35:11.416
The lover is from Pakistan.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.000
Oh, my dear love

00:35:13.083 --> 00:35:14.791
She is from Pakistan

00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:17.041
-Oh, my dear love
-Hey, shut up.

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:20.083
Stop all this nonsense.

00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:23.583
Before you get ready
for getting trapped for life,

00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:27.625
take this fruit.

00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:28.708
It is good for your health.

00:35:28.875 --> 00:35:29.958
Guruji, what about me?

00:35:30.041 --> 00:35:31.916
You won't need it. He needs it.

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:36.125
Convey my regards to Rabdi.

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:37.166
Rabdi?

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:39.166
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:40.708
He is very powerful, sir.

00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:43.291
There is some connection
between this fruit and that girl, sir.

00:35:43.458 --> 00:35:45.583
-No!
-There is, sir! Trust me.

00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:48.791
Look at the way he is
standing like a tower.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.375
-I'll manage him.
-Begum, all okay?

00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:52.916
Thank you for everything.
We are leaving.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.458
Please! Don't leave, Begum.

00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:58.541
Please come to my exchange tonight
and enjoy our hospitality and dinner.

00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:00.250
Both of you sleep with me.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.500
What?

00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:02.583
What are you saying?

00:36:02.666 --> 00:36:05.708
Is this how you talk to girls?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.750
What did I say, Pitobash?
Why is she upset?

00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:09.833
She is upset as you didn't
properly speak to her.

00:36:09.916 --> 00:36:11.000
No.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.291
Oh, no, that's not what I meant, Begum.

00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:17.166
What I meant was that,
both of you come to my place.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.166
You can take some rest there.

00:36:18.291 --> 00:36:22.250
And we will step out in
search of Feroze in the morning.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.750
It is quite risky
to be surrounded by rowdies.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.833
I feel this fellow is any
day safer than that mob.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.041
But we know nothing about him.

00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:30.375
I'll take care of it.

00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:33.958
Okay. We will come.

00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:36.083
-Please come, Begum.
-Please come.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.541
Come.

00:36:38.291 --> 00:36:39.291
Go there.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.041
Don't worry.

00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:44.791
Hope you had a good veneration, ma'am!

00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:46.041
Everything is fine, sir.

00:36:46.125 --> 00:36:48.541
Aradhya and I will
reach the resort in the morning.

00:36:48.708 --> 00:36:52.250
Just tell me your location.
I will pick you both.

00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:56.000
The place seems like a
Telephone Exchange, sir.

00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:57.958
The place is…

00:36:58.625 --> 00:36:59.500
Hello…

00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:01.041
Hello!

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.583
Hello, Chatur sir.

00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:05.250
Is he abandoning us?

00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:07.708
No way. You have the presentation.

00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:09.500
He needs it to present to the client.

00:37:09.583 --> 00:37:13.500
He will come to you.
Just wait and watch.

00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:15.791
-Are you sure?
-Begum…

00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:18.291
-Oh, no!
-He is back.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.583
Begum…

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:30.916
here's a special meal for you from afar.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:32.583
What's this?

00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:34.916
Your favorite dish.

00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:42.833
Beef Biryani.

00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:51.916
-Begum?
-You are an idiot!

00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:55.208
Ara!

00:37:55.666 --> 00:37:56.541
Crazy fellow.

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:59.708
How dare he offer beef biryani

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.166
to a vegetarian Brahmin girl like me!

00:38:02.375 --> 00:38:04.000
He will pay in hell for this misdeed.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.583
I feel like throwing up, Deepu!

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.708
Oh, sorry ma'am.

00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:12.375
I thought you loved beef
since you are from Pakistan.

00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:13.458
Get lost!

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.125
Don't you have vegetarians in India?

00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:18.291
We have vegetarians even in Pakistan.

00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:20.958
Ara is a pure vegetarian
Pakistani Muslim.

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:24.041
Pakistan-- Vegetarian Muslim?

00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:28.833
Oh God!

00:38:29.833 --> 00:38:32.416
Where the hell should I
fetch spinach and lentils from?

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.583
Thank you, Lord!

00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:36.291
Such tasty food after a long time!

00:38:36.708 --> 00:38:38.500
I will devour it.

00:38:38.958 --> 00:38:39.833
Pito.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.125
Sir.

00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:43.666
Do you know the meaning of gratitude?

00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:45.916
Remembering the good
done by someone for life!

00:38:46.083 --> 00:38:48.666
-I will remember her for life!
-Why, sir?

00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:52.875
-Sir, I don't eat nonvegetarian food.
-Leave the pieces aside and have the rice!

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.833
Sir!

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.916
Begum…

00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:02.208
feel at home.

00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:04.291
Don't be shy.

00:39:05.041 --> 00:39:05.958
Promise?

00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:11.541
Hey, Pito…

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.916
Are you sleeping here?

00:39:13.083 --> 00:39:14.833
Of course! Like every day.

00:39:14.958 --> 00:39:15.833
Hey, Pito…

00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:20.000
That girl is all alone.

00:39:20.916 --> 00:39:22.333
Their parents are not here.

00:39:23.916 --> 00:39:27.666
It will be awkward for her
to sleep next to both of us.

00:39:27.958 --> 00:39:29.833
What is awkward about
it, sir? She is like my sister.

00:39:30.083 --> 00:39:30.916
Isn't she yours too?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.833
Hey…

00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:35.750
She is my girl.

00:39:39.166 --> 00:39:40.000
Begum!

00:39:40.333 --> 00:39:41.708
You sleep here.

00:39:42.333 --> 00:39:43.166
Please.

00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:45.500
I will keep vigil outside.

00:39:46.958 --> 00:39:47.833
Please.

00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:50.125
I can't bear the chill outside, sir.

00:39:50.208 --> 00:39:51.166
Hey, let's go.

00:39:51.375 --> 00:39:52.208
Sir.

00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:55.500
How do they say "Good Night" in Pakistan?

00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:56.416
Shabba khair.

00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:01.041
Shabba khair, Begum.

00:40:01.958 --> 00:40:03.250
Shabba khair.

00:40:03.958 --> 00:40:04.791
Shabba khair.

00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:06.041
Shabba khair.

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:12.750
He is trying his best to seduce me.

00:40:13.875 --> 00:40:17.958
If I am not careful, I will become an
easy prey to him in this snowy weather.

00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:19.416
I have an idea.

00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:20.625
Tell me.

00:41:07.625 --> 00:41:12.291
Love with Aara
Beauty is her place…

00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:17.333
Sir is excited Begum is confused

00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:22.291
Love with Aara
Beauty is her place…

00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:23.541
My heart wants more

00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:25.875
Hey, come here.

00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:29.166
You are my Roja

00:41:30.416 --> 00:41:31.875
You are my dil se

00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.416

00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:42.083

00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:44.541

You are my Geetanjali

00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:10.708
He is her younger brother.

00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:12.166
No, I didn't see anyone.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.458
Did you see a small boy named Feroze?

00:42:15.541 --> 00:42:16.750
Go and search there.

00:42:16.875 --> 00:42:19.041
-Did you see a small boy?
-No.

00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:21.208
-Please have a look at her.
-No.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:24.541
Thank you.

00:42:26.083 --> 00:42:26.916
Sorry, Begum.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
In the ocean waves
You are my silent melody

00:42:32.125 --> 00:42:37.083
In your divine torrent
A fight started

00:42:37.166 --> 00:42:42.083
You are my partner
I am your commander

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:46.583
You are my friend I am your leader

00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:52.000
I will accept whatever decision you make

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.208
Okay, sweetheart

00:42:56.416 --> 00:42:58.208
You are my Roja

00:42:58.916 --> 00:43:01.333
You are my dil se

00:43:01.458 --> 00:43:03.500
You are my Anjali

00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:04.500
Pito…

00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:10.333
Oh, God.

00:43:12.541 --> 00:43:16.583
Let's get every orphan boy named Feroze
in Kashmir and present him to Begum.

00:43:16.916 --> 00:43:18.375
-Get up. Let's go.
-Psycho.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.500
-Feroze.
-No.

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.083
-Feroze.
-Haleem.

00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:24.000
Haleem.

00:43:24.083 --> 00:43:26.208
Nice name. "555" serves tasty stuff.

00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:27.958
Are you Feroze? Oh no!

00:43:28.958 --> 00:43:29.958
I am Feroze!

00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:39.625
Useless fellow, Feroze!
You don't know how to do this.

00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:41.333
Don't know how the world works.

00:43:42.458 --> 00:43:44.625
Hey, Feroze, where are
you taking the flock to?

00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:47.166
Hey, Feroze…

00:43:51.708 --> 00:43:52.750
Praise the Lord.

00:43:57.416 --> 00:43:58.333
Feroze?

00:43:58.916 --> 00:43:59.791
Come here.

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:03.875
Where's your mom and dad?

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.083
Not there?

00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:06.208
Do you want ice cream?

00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:08.541
Would you like to have one?
Come with me.

00:44:09.208 --> 00:44:10.708
Hey, Mustak. Come here.

00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:12.750
-Someone has kidnapped Feroze.
-He is an orphan but has relatives, sir.

00:44:12.958 --> 00:44:14.708
-Who are you all? Someone stop them.
-Sir, we will get caught.

00:44:14.791 --> 00:44:16.375
Who is taking Feroze? Stop.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.625
Brother, give me two cups of tea.

00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:27.583
Hey, Feroze.

00:44:30.166 --> 00:44:32.291
If I slap you once, you
will come to your senses.

00:44:35.333 --> 00:44:36.833
Did you see his cat eyes, sir?

00:44:37.083 --> 00:44:38.625
He may not be Ara's brother.

00:44:39.291 --> 00:44:41.416
Let Begum confirm that, not you.

00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:47.458
-Ready. One, two, three!
-Praise the Lord!

00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:50.083
-Chatur Sir, listen to me.
-Where the hell are you guys?

00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:51.666
Stop scolding, sir.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.083
-This is a hill station called Pampur.
-What?

00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:55.166
There…

00:44:55.458 --> 00:44:57.583
Come on, boys. Hey, get them.

00:44:58.875 --> 00:44:59.750
Begum…

00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:02.625
all of them are named Feroze.

00:45:03.416 --> 00:45:04.250
Come here.

00:45:04.375 --> 00:45:06.333
Who is your Feroze here?

00:45:08.666 --> 00:45:09.500
No one.

00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:11.750
Ma'am, just look at him once.

00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:15.458
Look at him. He looks just like you.

00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:18.041
No.

00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:25.083
Drop them back, Pitobash.

00:45:25.625 --> 00:45:26.666
Come on. Let's go.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.833
No, we won't leave.

00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:30.375
Why won't you go? We
can't feed you food. Let's go.

00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:33.166
If we go back, we will all get beaten up.

00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:35.791
Yes, brother. They will beat us all.

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:49.625
It's all because of you.

00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:54.250
He is roaming with us just
because you made up a story.

00:45:54.666 --> 00:45:55.875
-Let me tell the truth.
-Hey!

00:45:56.458 --> 00:45:58.666
Just stay silent for a day.
We shall leave tomorrow.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.250
Chatur sir is on his way.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.833
Karim, my friend is here from Hyderabad.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.375
These are all the
boys who lost their way.

00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:08.083
Please check the register and
call for any of their kith and kin.

00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:09.708
-What's the name?
-Feroze.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.958
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

00:46:13.083 --> 00:46:16.583
If there's anyone amongst you
who is their parent, please come here.

00:46:16.708 --> 00:46:19.625
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.000
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

00:46:22.083 --> 00:46:22.958
Feroze…

00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:27.000
Feroze!

00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:30.250
Mom.

00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:32.416
My son!

00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:34.750
Mom!

00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.666
Where did you go?

00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:52.166
Where did you go?

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.625
Begum…

00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:59.291
I did all this to impress you…

00:47:01.833 --> 00:47:03.625
but looking at this
mother's separation pangs.

00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.375
I promise you will find your
Feroze before you go to Pakistan.

00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:34.333
At the beginning of my love
You became my continuity

00:47:34.416 --> 00:47:39.416
To your heartbeat
I can become the echo

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:44.458
When our eyes meet mine
I dreamt of many dreams

00:47:44.541 --> 00:47:48.791
I want to be in your footsteps in
your Journey and be in your shadow

00:47:48.916 --> 00:47:54.541
I will agree to whatever you say

00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:56.791
Is that fine, Begum?

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:03.291
Love with Aara Beauty is her place

00:48:03.458 --> 00:48:07.791
Sir is excited Begum is confused

00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:10.458
You are my Roja

00:48:11.375 --> 00:48:13.041
You are my dil se

00:48:13.208 --> 00:48:14.041
Hello.

00:48:14.208 --> 00:48:16.250
Chatur sir, where are you now?

00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:18.083
I am near Pampur.

00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:20.875
Something is wrong over here.
Please come fast.

00:48:21.583 --> 00:48:26.125
Love with Aara Beauty is her place

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.750
Sir is excited Begum is confused

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.416
You are my roja

00:48:34.291 --> 00:48:35.791
You are my dil se

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.208
You are my Anjali

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.750
You are my Geethanjali

00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:43.333
You are my roja

00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:45.875
You are my dil se

00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:48.333
You are my Anjali

00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:51.333
You are my Geethanjali

00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:00.541
Deepu…

00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:04.416
I want to tell the truth to Viplav.

00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:27.666
Begum.

00:49:28.708 --> 00:49:29.541
What happened?

00:49:30.875 --> 00:49:32.125
Aren't you able to sleep?

00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:36.125
Please come, Begum. Please sit.

00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:38.416
Please sit. Two minutes.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.166
It's cold, right?

00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:45.375
Even I couldn't sleep.

00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.291
Do you know how I am feeling, Begum?

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.625
This looks like our home…

00:49:57.833 --> 00:49:59.250
where we are happily married…

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.500
with two kids.

00:50:03.958 --> 00:50:07.958
I feel as if we just served
them dinner and put them to bed,

00:50:08.833 --> 00:50:13.416
and merrily chatting in
the balcony outside like this.

00:50:15.916 --> 00:50:17.416
I can live my life this way.

00:50:21.375 --> 00:50:23.625
And pass out one day
just staring at you, Begum.

00:50:25.958 --> 00:50:27.416
I didn't understand at all.

00:50:28.666 --> 00:50:29.500
I know!

00:50:41.875 --> 00:50:44.291
Uncle, one special tea
with double cashew nuts!

00:50:45.083 --> 00:50:46.000
You won't drink?

00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:47.708
I will have it with Begum.

00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:48.625
Really?

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.208
Just like Begum warmed up to tea,

00:50:53.416 --> 00:50:55.041
she will take a liking
to me too in the future.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.791
I hope you will come
to visit me in Pakistan!

00:51:00.333 --> 00:51:01.250
I will if you are alive.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:04.583
Thank you, Uncle.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.416
Write in my account.

00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:12.125
What's the point of
walking so far just to get tea?

00:51:12.208 --> 00:51:13.041
My legs are hurting.

00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:13.958
This tea can be had…

00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:15.666
Begum is sleeping.

00:51:16.166 --> 00:51:17.000
Okay.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:21.833
Begum…

00:51:24.708 --> 00:51:25.541
Begum…

00:51:28.333 --> 00:51:29.291
Ara Begum!

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:32.625
Sir…

00:51:34.083 --> 00:51:35.000
please look there.

00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:38.875
Begum has fled.

00:51:39.125 --> 00:51:40.541
Keep munching cashew nuts now.

00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:43.541
You were talking about Pakistan.

00:51:47.166 --> 00:51:49.458
These days there's
no guarantee for lovers.

00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:51.000
Whereas yours is from Pakistan.

00:51:51.083 --> 00:51:52.041
WE HAVE FOUND FEROZE.
WE ARE LEAVING FOR PAKISTAN.

00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:54.250
She found her younger
brother and hence she left.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.291
No problem. Let's go and sleep inside.

00:51:57.625 --> 00:52:00.333
-It is biting cold outside.
-Begum still loves me.

00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:03.250
I've seen it.

00:52:05.958 --> 00:52:06.833
Didn't you?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.458
Ours is an inter-nation marriage.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.458
Maybe, she was skeptical
about it and hence she left.

00:52:19.291 --> 00:52:21.458
If need be, I will even
take Sania Mirza's help

00:52:22.083 --> 00:52:24.208
to reach out to her family to
convince her elders for the marriage.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:28.333
Sir, the Begum would have
taken the Amritsar Express by now

00:52:28.458 --> 00:52:30.166
to cross the Wagah border.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.791
-Come, let's go to Pakistan.
-Pa--

00:52:52.375 --> 00:52:53.375
JAMMU TAWI - AMRITSAR

00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:05.833
Brother, did you see two Muslim
girls along with a young boy?

00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:13.166
Pitobash.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.041
JAMMU TAWI - HYDERABAD - TIRUPATI

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.833
Michael, the presentation--

00:53:19.916 --> 00:53:21.291
-Why are you blocking the way?
-Hey, you fool.

00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:33.125
Why did you do this, Ara?

00:53:35.125 --> 00:53:36.416
I fell in love with you

00:53:37.666 --> 00:53:40.000
and you ditched me like this.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.208
Oh, man! I can't talk in Hindi.

00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:45.625
Do something, Pitobash.

00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:47.500
Ma'am, please. Please go there.

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:49.291
Sir!

00:53:50.291 --> 00:53:51.125
Begum…

00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:55.208
I already told you, I am
with you till death do us part.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.500
I know you have the same feelings for me.

00:53:59.416 --> 00:54:02.458
Don't get scared. Let's go to Pakistan.

00:54:03.166 --> 00:54:05.583
We need to get on to the
train to Pakistan, Begum.

00:54:05.708 --> 00:54:07.708
-Not this one. This one goes to Hyderabad.
-Yes, that's right.

00:54:07.916 --> 00:54:09.541
Let's leave now. I am coming with you.

00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:11.083
Give the luggage, ma'am.

00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:14.000
Where's Feroze? Look for him, dude.

00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:16.000
-Feroze!
-Tell me, Begum.

00:54:17.583 --> 00:54:18.416
I am not a Begum.

00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:20.000
Brahmin.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:21.666
Pitobash…

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.041
did she just speak in Telugu?

00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:26.416
She also said she's a Brahmin.

00:54:26.541 --> 00:54:28.000
-Br… Brahmin?
-Yes.

00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:31.041
My name is Aradhya.

00:54:32.125 --> 00:54:32.958
From Kakinada.

00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:35.458
-Kaki--
-What's happening here, dude?

00:54:36.666 --> 00:54:38.958
What about Feroze?

00:54:39.916 --> 00:54:40.791
And Pakistan?

00:54:43.875 --> 00:54:47.375
We just made it up to

00:54:48.208 --> 00:54:49.458
avoid getting followed by you.

00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:52.333
You can make up words, but
you can't change countries like this.

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:54.708
Forget all that.

00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:58.250
Do you love me?

00:55:02.708 --> 00:55:04.875
I believe in God and destiny.

00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:08.791
After passing all the
hurdles, I held your hand

00:55:09.708 --> 00:55:12.125
and felt blessed after having
visiting Mamuleshwar Lord.

00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:17.416
Those days spent with you at the Exchange

00:55:18.458 --> 00:55:22.583
and the pains you took to search for a
Feroze who didn't exist melted my heart.

00:55:24.666 --> 00:55:27.791
I fought hard to hide
my feelings towards you.

00:55:32.875 --> 00:55:34.625
Without knowing anything
about me or my antecedents, you

00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:36.166
were prepared to spend
the rest of your life with me.

00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:40.125
That very moment I fell in love with you.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:41.125
But--

00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:42.208
That's enough.

00:55:43.958 --> 00:55:45.625
I will never leave your hand.

00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:48.291
Hey, saint.

00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:51.083
Can we stop that nonsense for a while?

00:55:51.875 --> 00:55:53.250
I am discussing the most
important matter of my life.

00:55:53.333 --> 00:55:54.416
-Nonsense! Don't talk like that.
-Hey!

00:55:55.166 --> 00:55:57.333
-You can't call that nonsense, dear.
-Hey, it's all a nuisance.

00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:00.166
It's a holy discourse.
Seek his pardon.

00:56:00.958 --> 00:56:01.916
Do it, sir.

00:56:03.083 --> 00:56:04.625
The discourse is by my dad himself.

00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:09.125
Who is it?

00:56:09.208 --> 00:56:10.041
Don't you know him?

00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:12.083
The famous preacher from Kakinada.

00:56:12.333 --> 00:56:14.958
Don't you know
Mr. Chadarangam Srinivas Rao himself?

00:56:30.625 --> 00:56:32.208
Our religion is an eternal one.

00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:38.708
It outlasted various invasions
and the attacks from atheists.

00:56:39.875 --> 00:56:40.833
The path of devotion.

00:56:44.625 --> 00:56:45.916
Don't you see the "Bhakti" channel?

00:56:47.375 --> 00:56:48.500
Do you know my dad?

00:56:48.958 --> 00:56:49.833
Who?

00:56:50.375 --> 00:56:52.291
He is the president of the
State Atheists Association.

00:56:53.125 --> 00:56:54.125
Lenin Satyam.

00:56:54.833 --> 00:56:56.208
Are you his son?

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:57.583
Yes.

00:56:58.833 --> 00:57:02.625
Well, then both our dads hate each
other and are diametrically opposite.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.166
Do you think this will work out?

00:57:08.416 --> 00:57:10.000
I didn't give up when it was Pakistan.

00:57:11.416 --> 00:57:12.833
I won't give up now
even if it's Kakinada.

00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:16.000
Don't give up.

00:57:20.666 --> 00:57:23.416
In two weeks, we'll witness
a complete lunar eclipse.

00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:25.750
While the atheists are describing
it as a celestial spectacle,

00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:28.083
the pandits are apprehending
it will bring in more doom.

00:57:28.166 --> 00:57:29.708
We'll soon find out the truth.

00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:31.625
Let's welcome our two seasoned speakers,

00:57:31.833 --> 00:57:34.541
famous atheist, Mr. Satyam Lenin

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.583
and noted Hindu preceptor,

00:57:36.666 --> 00:57:39.041
Mr. Chadarangam Srinivas Rao
who will debate this out.

00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.833
-Welcome, Mr. Chadarangam.
-Greetings.

00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:43.916
Can we see the moon on new moon day?

00:57:44.583 --> 00:57:47.083
The lunar eclipse happens
because of Rahu.

00:57:47.875 --> 00:57:51.000
This lunar eclipse happens
because Rahu is swallowing the moon.

00:57:51.458 --> 00:57:52.833
Is the moon chocolate…

00:57:54.208 --> 00:57:55.250
to be swallowed by Rahu?

00:57:56.333 --> 00:57:59.375
Where is Rahu to be found
amongst our nine planets?

00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:02.583
It's just a shadow of
the earth on the moon.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.250
You are unnecessarily scaring the public.

00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:07.166
Look here.

00:58:07.333 --> 00:58:11.333
Our saints have determined the planetary
movements without the help of a telescope.

00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:13.000
What do you have to say to that?

00:58:13.958 --> 00:58:15.958
What's this crap about
saints and spirits?

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.833
It's better if such
people stay at ashrams.

00:58:19.208 --> 00:58:20.375
We won't keep quiet if they have.

00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:23.083
We cannot suffer their stupid
views corrupting the public.

00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:25.083
You please share your
views Mr. Chadarangam

00:58:25.166 --> 00:58:27.708
and the list of do's and don'ts that day.

00:58:28.666 --> 00:58:29.500
Nothing dramatic.

00:58:29.833 --> 00:58:33.416
You shouldn't have any food
or take a bath during the eclipse.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.000
Can we take nature's calls?

00:58:36.625 --> 00:58:41.375
Don't you go to the doctor
if you get a heart attack or an ache?

00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:45.666
We should be ashamed of why we are
organizing such debates such as this.

00:58:45.791 --> 00:58:46.833
-This is ridiculous.
-Please!

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.958
-I will not talk to this brainless fellow.
-Mr. Satyam.

00:58:50.166 --> 00:58:52.583
-Please, Mr. Satyam. Let's talk.
-What is there to talk about?

00:58:53.208 --> 00:58:54.791
Why is he talking without decorum?

00:58:54.875 --> 00:58:55.750
One minute. Please stop.

00:58:55.833 --> 00:58:58.500
He talks only baloney. How
can he command any respect?

00:58:58.583 --> 00:59:00.833
-Let's have a nice debate.
-Why are you barking like a dog?

00:59:01.083 --> 00:59:03.250
Did the dog bite you
on the way to the studio?

00:59:03.708 --> 00:59:05.916
Uncle, let's leave now.
We have to catch the train.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.833
They are conveniently evading
us and running away from here.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.291
We are not scared.

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:12.833
You are safe because
this is not Kakinada.

00:59:13.125 --> 00:59:15.250
Step in Kakinada to see
who is more powerful.

00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:16.500
-Calm down, son.
-Shut up and get out.

00:59:16.583 --> 00:59:18.416
Why talk with such ignoramuses?

00:59:18.916 --> 00:59:21.041
See how he is talking without
any etiquette and restraint?

00:59:21.458 --> 00:59:22.291
Jaffer…

00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:25.583
Don't call me for a debate
with this fellow ever again.

00:59:25.708 --> 00:59:26.541
It's over.

00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:31.500
Sir, Viplav requested for an immediate
transfer from Kashmir to Hyderabad.

00:59:31.875 --> 00:59:35.666
His mother has asthma.

00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:39.250
His father has back pain issues.

00:59:39.791 --> 00:59:41.208
He has to take care of his parents.

00:59:42.625 --> 00:59:44.166
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

00:59:48.958 --> 00:59:51.916
What a breezy love story in just a week
of seeing each other! And now marriage.

00:59:54.666 --> 00:59:56.250
Is she so good-looking?

00:59:57.458 --> 00:59:59.291
She is as beautiful as
the Kakinada beach, ma'am.

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:26.958
My granddaughter prayed for me

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.458
at Mamuleshwar temple.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:33.250
I got fully cured after that.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:43.958
Mr. Chadarangam.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.708
This is our contribution towards
your discourse at Annavaram.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:48.958
Oh, no!

01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:51.375
I don't take money for giving discourses.

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:53.250
It's all in the service of God.

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:55.500
Mr. Sankarrao.

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:56.791
Did you see NTV last night?

01:00:57.291 --> 01:01:00.166
My uncle gave a proper comeuppance
to that stupid atheist Satyam.

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:01.166
I saw that, sir.

01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:03.000
He is the perfect antidote to such folks.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.416
She is singing well. Are you
looking for a groom for her?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.833
Yes.

01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:18.416
We should be ashamed of why
we are organizing such debates!

01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:20.500
Why are you barking like a dog?

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.291
Did the dog bite you
on the way to the studio?

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:24.708
Jaffer!

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:27.250
On the next new moon day,
all of us are going to watch

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:30.208
the lunar eclipse and
have our favorite biryani.

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.708
If we don't get harmed,

01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:35.833
ask if Mr. Chadarangam
can keep quiet after that.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.333
Call him for a debate.
I will not spare him.

01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:42.000
Arrange discussion in
Kakinada if possible. I'll come.

01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:51.291
Oh, no, it's you!

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.083
I dreaded if it was your dad.

01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:59.208
Mr. Chadarangam's
discourses are engrossing.

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:00.125
Mom!

01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:04.291
Do you know Mr. Chadarangam's
daughter is even better.

01:02:04.916 --> 01:02:06.541
What? Who are you talking about?

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:12.916
Your daughter-in-law.

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:14.833
She is so beautiful.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:16.541
She is Mr. Chadarangam's daughter.

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:18.500
Her name is Aradhya.

01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:22.041
We met in Kashmir and fell in love.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:25.291
Only you can get us married, Mom.

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:29.750
I pray that it happens for real.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:34.000
At least, she will address
me as "Mother-in-law"

01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:37.250
instead of mispronouncing
my name like your sister-in-law.

01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:38.250
Am I right?

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:39.166
Shall I call her?

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:40.958
-Right now?
-I will call her.

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:47.958
Viplav!

01:02:48.375 --> 01:02:49.958
-Baby!
-Baby!

01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:52.583
Talk to my mom.

01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:54.708
Here you go.

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:57.166
Hello!

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.083
Auntie.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.750
Can you call me Mother-in-law?

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:03.250
Mother-in-law!

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.041
One more time!

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:08.000
Mother-in-law!

01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:11.416
What a blessing!

01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:14.166
Hey, who's this "Mother-in-law"?

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.125
In Kashmir…

01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:18.666
In Kashmir?

01:03:21.041 --> 01:03:22.625
I fell in love with this boy, Grandma.

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:24.166
Who's this boy?

01:03:25.041 --> 01:03:26.375
Did you take your tablets?

01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:30.250
Son of Mr. Lenin Satyam.

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:33.166
Oh, my God! Son of Lenin Satyam?

01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:34.625
Grandma, quiet!

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.916
He is coming to Annavaram
tomorrow to talk to Dad.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:38.166
You must take care of the rest.

01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:40.750
I can't?

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:42.583
Please…

01:03:43.875 --> 01:03:44.791
Oh God!

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:46.041
Annavaram!

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.833
Annavaram?

01:03:48.166 --> 01:03:50.250
Dad will censure us if hears this!

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:51.708
Let's do it before he comes to know.

01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:53.416
-Don't involve me in this.
-Mom…

01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:55.375
She will call you mother-in-law, Mom.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:11.541
Tulasidas wrote this brilliant
line in Hanuman Chalisa.

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:17.041
It describes how Lord Hanuman
leaped into the sky seeing a glowing sun…

01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:20.791
mistaking it for a fruit and traveled
thousands of miles to kiss the Sun.

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:25.291
That's how powerful Hanuman is.

01:04:26.458 --> 01:04:27.541
Hail Hanuman!

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.041
Hail Hanuman!

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:30.458
This is enough for my life, son.

01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.583
Forget about the devotion,
focus on the main job, Mom.

01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:34.291
-Come and talk.
-Me?

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:35.916
-Salutations, sir.
-Dear.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:38.000
Blessings to you. Who are you?

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:40.375
-I am your big fan, sir.
-Great.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:46.833
-Both of us are deeply religious, Guruji.
-It is quite self-evident.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.166
But my husband is an atheist.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.583
He doesn't even bow before God, Guruji.

01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:52.375
-He…
-And chastises anyone who does it.

01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:54.416
He even beats them, Guruji.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.708
Everyone is different in a family.

01:04:57.208 --> 01:05:02.375
Don't you feel angry
about such people, Guruji?

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:05.583
Why should I get angry with your husband?

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.083
Ask him, Mom.

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:12.166
Then…

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:17.041
will you give consent to your
daughter Aradhya to marry my son?

01:05:18.708 --> 01:05:19.541
What?

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:21.750
Marriage?

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:23.666
I am Mr. Lenin Satyam's son, Guruji.

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:25.541
Aradhya and I love each other.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:28.541
We would like to get
married, if you agree.

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:32.125
With just a twist of logic, look how
they trapped our daughter, Uncle.

01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:34.000
And the alliance is the
son of the noted atheist.

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:35.541
At least Aradhya should
have had some sense.

01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:43.583
-Oh, Guruji is leaving.
-Mom.

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:44.833
Guruji!

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:52.833
How did you fall in
love with Satyam's son?

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.333
I didn't know that Viplav
is Mr. Satyam's son, Dad.

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:56.666
Mr. Satyam, it seems!

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.666
He is an educated fool.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.041
He undermines the faith of people and
keeps hurting their religious sentiments.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:05.791
Why should we have an
alliance with such folks?

01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:08.291
We should have some discretion.

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:10.208
Love knows no discretion.

01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:12.166
At least you should have had some sense.

01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:14.375
Why are you defending her?

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.125
Well, haven't you seen the boy
and his mother in the temple?

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:23.208
They were so good and
the boy looks handsome.

01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:25.208
We have seen many folks like him.

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:26.750
You please stop.

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:27.708
You wait.

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:32.333
Both, the boy and
the girl love each other.

01:06:33.083 --> 01:06:35.000
Let's go as per our tradition.

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.625
We will wait for
Satyam's consent as well.

01:06:37.916 --> 01:06:39.833
-What do you think?
-Why should we even talk to them?

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:42.041
Do we want to push our
daughter into that dungeon?

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:42.958
Uncle!

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.000
-We'll send her off. Who am I?
-Uncle…

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:47.666
He is coming here because of his son.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:49.125
He needs it now.

01:06:49.916 --> 01:06:52.250
We will settle scores
with him right here.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.125
Dear son, look at her face.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:56.500
Uncle, please agree. We will needle him.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:59.333
She is very keen on
him. He is a good boy.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.541
-Uncle, accept this. It's a great chance.
-Agree to their marriage.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:06.000
Okay, let's talk.

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:10.708
We will not go home but
meet somewhere outside.

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:13.750
Let's talk.

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.916
Dad, Aradhya is not like her dad.

01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:22.875
She is very practical
and logical like us.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.250
Mom, didn't you see that?

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.541
She is quite modern, dear.

01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:29.000
Shall I put some powder?

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:36.666
After marriage, Chadarangam will change
your name from Viplav to Vipranarayana.

01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:40.125
He is a fool who injects ignorance
and dogma into people's minds.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.750
And you fell in love with his daughter.

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:43.958
Dad, I want to marry Aradhya,

01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:45.666
not her father.

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:50.708
Anyway, they are visiting us
tomorrow to discuss the alliance.

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:54.791
Is he coming?

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:56.708
Let him come.

01:07:57.708 --> 01:08:00.750
But let's meet them somewhere
outside and not in our house.

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:03.166
Okay, Dad.

01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:21.083
Look…

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.250
According to my uncle, it's not the
appropriate time to talk about marriage.

01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:25.500
What?

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:34.250
Tell me.

01:08:34.458 --> 01:08:35.833
Let me come straight to the point.

01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.208
My son is in love with your daughter.

01:08:38.458 --> 01:08:40.333
Don't stop this marriage. That's it!

01:08:40.458 --> 01:08:41.333
That's it.

01:08:43.291 --> 01:08:46.458
Can you give a good reason why my daughter
deserves to step into your household?

01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:49.916
We are not fussy about
caste, creed, and religion.

01:08:50.208 --> 01:08:51.166
We are not ritualistic.

01:08:51.708 --> 01:08:55.541
We don't pick auspicious
moments for doing anything.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.750
All we care about is they are in love.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.083
That's all.

01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:00.958
You may think that's enough.

01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:03.750
But we need to match
their horoscopes as well.

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:05.458
What?

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:07.750
Horoscopes?

01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:09.125
We don't believe in them.

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:10.500
We are done here. Come.

01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:12.250
-Viplav. Let's leave.
-Wait.

01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:13.833
-Dad.
-What planet are they from?

01:09:14.208 --> 01:09:16.291
-Let's leave.
-First, why should we get down?

01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:18.166
It will look bad. Let them get down.

01:09:18.416 --> 01:09:19.416
We look bad, Uncle.

01:09:21.708 --> 01:09:22.541
Let's not do it then.

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.000
Sit down, Dad.

01:09:25.541 --> 01:09:27.625
-Is this why you planned this in metro?
-Keep quiet.

01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:29.458
-You're a genius!
-Sit down!

01:09:31.708 --> 01:09:33.416
We don't want to check
the horoscope. What next?

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.416
Well, for whatever good,

01:09:35.708 --> 01:09:38.125
I did cast Viplav's horoscope
when he was born, Guruji!

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:40.416
Give it.

01:09:41.333 --> 01:09:42.166
Oh, no.

01:09:42.458 --> 01:09:43.291
Oh, no.

01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:44.291
What are you doing?

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:53.458
It's the original, Guruji.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.125
The girl's star is Uttarashada.

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:15.583
The boy's star is Rohini.

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:18.458
It is going to be opposites
like a snake and a mongoose.

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:20.083
They will fight till death, Guruji.

01:10:24.541 --> 01:10:26.375
-It's a big defect!
-What?

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:30.250
If they marry, they will invite
untold misery and mayhem…

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:32.458
and problems galore from
misunderstandings to miscarriage.

01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:37.416
If they marry, they will have all the
mayhem that a marriage shouldn't bring.

01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:42.125
What's the remedy, Guruji?

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:45.333
Both father and son should
do a remedial oblation.

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:46.750
An oblation?!

01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:51.208
The boy should anoint a copper plate
with sacred mantras on the entrance,

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:53.916
chant the hymn Mahamrutyunjaya mantra,

01:10:55.458 --> 01:11:00.125
donate clothes, food, and a cow to
brahmin priests and the cow dung…

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:02.166
And plaster the cow
dung on the wall, right?

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.416
I don't care about you, but I
am not approving of this marriage.

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:09.666
Let's leave.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:10.875
-Even we want that.
-Dad…

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:11.833
-Let's go, Uncle.
-Sir.

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:13.708
Don't mind, Guruji.
I am leaving, dear.

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:15.000
Come, dear.

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:16.875
-What are you staring at? Come.
-We made a total mess of it.

01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:25.458
Let's go, Uncle.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.458
Do you see their stupidity?

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:37.666
Do you still want to marry the girl?

01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:43.583
Even if he had agreed,
I would have never approved it.

01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:47.000
Dad…

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:50.291
we need no permission from anybody.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.125
I am going to marry Aradhya…

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.333
tomorrow.

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:04.541
So, you are already ready.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:08.500
You stop.

01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:15.791
Look, my dear Aradhya.

01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.000
I am speaking to you not as a dad…

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:25.500
but as Chadarangam Srinivas Rao
who's well-versed in scriptures.

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:29.750
He has a snag in his horoscope

01:12:30.791 --> 01:12:31.958
because of which, your
future happiness is bleak.

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:36.041
Convince him for an oblation ceremony.

01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:39.125
Or else, you will see hell in marriage.

01:12:40.916 --> 01:12:44.000
I can't force this on him, Dad.

01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:47.875
Viplav is a good boy.

01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:57.833
He will take good care of me.
Just like you.

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:03.375
-Without him…
-You can't live, right?

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:05.791
-But you can live without us.
-No, Dad.

01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:07.791
-So, you can be without us.
-Dad, I didn't…

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.000
So, it is fine.

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:10.583
Did you hear that?

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:13.375
-Dad, not that, dad.
-That's what you said. It's okay.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.708
Dear, get that suitcase.
Finished packing?

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:17.541
Get it now. She will go.

01:13:17.708 --> 01:13:18.916
Uncle, How can we let go like that?

01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:20.416
-Let her go.
-You wait, dear.

01:13:20.666 --> 01:13:22.291
We can explain things to others.

01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:24.208
But some things must
be experienced first-hand.

01:13:24.583 --> 01:13:26.000
She will come back in six months.

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:27.250
Watch out.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:28.708
Uncle, please.

01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:30.958
-Dad, I will stay for a while.
-Okay. You get going.

01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:32.458
Don't worry. Give that to me.

01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:34.458
Listen to me.
Take your laptop.

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.041
-I will stay here for a while, Dad.
-Take that also.

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:38.375
-Let her go.
-Pandu, listen to me.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.125
You can leave as well.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:41.750
Listen to me, son…

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:43.375
-He is waiting for you.
-Dad.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:44.583
Go.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.083
Is that how a father behaves?

01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.916
Why is he cursing his daughter?

01:14:19.333 --> 01:14:21.750
Why is he slamming the door in the face?

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.333
If someone slams the door
on me, I don't bother about them.

01:14:25.416 --> 01:14:26.583
-I don't want my family.
-Hey.

01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:27.833
Then I don't want them either.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.083
-Let's not take any sides, okay?
-Okay.

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:32.666
Okay. Let's not take sides.

01:14:34.166 --> 01:14:37.791
Let's prove to the world
what an ideal couple we are.

01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:39.125
Yes, we'll show it them.

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:40.250
We'll show it to them.

01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:41.541
We will.

01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:02.625
We will prove it to them.

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:06.458
We will prove it to them.

01:15:08.166 --> 01:15:10.000
We will prove it to them.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:12.208
We will prove it to them.

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:14.958
We will show it to all who
believe in horoscopes.

01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:16.458
And to your dad.

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:18.166
And to those disbelievers.

01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:21.375
-We'll show to everybody.
-Let's show the world.

01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:28.708
Viplav.

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:31.291
What happened?

01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:38.250
A black cat.

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:40.916
So, what?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:42.875
Bad omen.

01:15:43.958 --> 01:15:44.791
What is it?

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.458
We shouldn't leave immediately, Viplav.

01:15:50.666 --> 01:15:54.041
Shall we stop for two minutes and go?

01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:55.916
Okay?

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.625
Everybody, clap!

01:16:18.416 --> 01:16:20.166
-Who are the witnesses?
-Myself.

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:24.500
I hope you'll take good care of her.

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:26.416
Ma'am?! Me?

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:27.416
I know he will take care of me.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:29.541
Look at how she's relying on you.

01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:35.958
Now that you're married,
what will you call our boy?

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.291
Hello, husband!

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:41.083
-Oh. That's so boring. What's this?
-Boring.

01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:42.291
Viplav!

01:16:42.375 --> 01:16:43.875
-That's what I call him.
-Correct!

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:45.791
Anything else, Aradhya?

01:16:48.458 --> 01:16:49.458
Kanna.

01:16:49.666 --> 01:16:50.583
Kanna!

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:52.000
That's so cute.

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:53.041
Did you eat anything, Kanna?

01:16:53.166 --> 01:16:55.041
Kanna!

01:16:57.291 --> 01:17:00.291
Hey, the wedding is over.
What about the party, Pushpa?

01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:02.208
Nobody should be seen around

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:04.208
-for the next three days!
-Viplav!

01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:08.625
The most improbable marriage between
the son of noted atheist Mr. Lenin Satyam…

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:12.041
and the daughter of a famous Hindu
speaker Mr. Chadarangam Srinivasa Rao

01:17:12.166 --> 01:17:14.541
happened at the registrar's office today…

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:16.625
Look they are coming here!

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:17.875
-Hail for…
-Viplav!

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:19.583
Do your parents know about your marriage?

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:21.541
Or did you alienate your
parents for this marriage?

01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:22.916
We didn't alienate them.

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:25.333
Okay, but what if both of you
spar in future like your parents?

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.625
-We don't want to give such a chance…
-Then how will you manage?

01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:35.833
With love.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:41.083
Do you see any remorse
on her face, Uncle?

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:44.000
You better keep your mouth shut.

01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:48.375
Pandu, if you keep these aspersions aside,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.041
they both look lovely as a pair.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.916
Then, why don't you divvy
them up with some lighting?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.000
This won't last long.

01:17:57.833 --> 01:17:59.458
Uncle did mention about the
defect in the boy's horoscope.

01:18:00.041 --> 01:18:04.000
Both the uncles will forget all
their differences to cradle the babies…

01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:14.875
Thomas cooks tasty biryani.

01:18:16.166 --> 01:18:18.750
But nobody knows the secret recipe.

01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:22.666
Hey, I will share. Let me tell you…

01:18:24.791 --> 01:18:25.750
Viplavam?

01:18:25.833 --> 01:18:27.583
-Viplav.
-Sorry, Viplav.

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:29.041
Viplav.

01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:34.708
I wanted to surprise Zoya on the day of
our marriage with biryani made with love.

01:18:35.416 --> 01:18:40.708
That's it! I stopped cooking since then.

01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:46.750
-Can you cook, Aradhya?
-What are you talking, ma'am?

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.416
-Aradhya makes amazing puliogare?
-Hey!

01:18:51.541 --> 01:18:55.250
It's the best puliogare I ate
in the whole of Annavaram.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:57.625
The credit goes to her family.

01:18:57.708 --> 01:18:58.750
Wow.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:01.541
Aradhya, you can learn
culinary skills from Thomas.

01:19:02.291 --> 01:19:04.333
And then you can order Viplav
to do your bidding because

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:06.583
he will literally eat out
of your hands after that.

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:09.916
Do you both stay here?

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:14.583
Yes, we have a daughter, Lissy.

01:19:15.166 --> 01:19:17.083
She stays in our native place Alleppey.

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:20.666
She loves nature, and silence.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:23.166
We go there to meet her
on her birthday every year.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:24.833
Have it…

01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:26.833
Serve them some biryani!

01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:33.333
What are you doing?

01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:36.291
Are you done?

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:40.291
Did you like it, Aradhya?

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:43.375
Take it home.

01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:45.125
Aradhya, shall we leave?

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:49.041
Viplav, why do you
go to that old quarters?

01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:52.291
It smells of fresh paint.
Why don't you stay back?

01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:55.333
We don't want to disturb you.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.166
That's all right.
We will manage.

01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.958
The mosquitoes won't let you sleep!

01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:01.500
Please give us the mosquito
coil, ma'am! We are used to it.

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:03.208
Why do you have to suffer?

01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:07.125
Ma'am, just spare us a pillow
and a quilt. We'll manage it.

01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:10.416
Hey, let them go.

01:20:13.916 --> 01:20:14.791
Okay.

01:20:15.666 --> 01:20:16.583
Hey, why did you say that?

01:20:16.666 --> 01:20:18.083
Only then will our work go smoothly.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.333
Whichever leg we use
to step inside the house

01:20:28.541 --> 01:20:30.375
it's going to
offend one of our dads.

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:31.458
What should we do?

01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:37.000
I won't allow you to keep
your leg on the floor at all!

01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:40.500
You are my sunshine

01:20:40.583 --> 01:20:41.583
You are my moonlight

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:43.833
You are the stars in the sky

01:20:44.291 --> 01:20:45.916
Come with me now

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:48.208
You have my desire

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:50.291
Come along

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:55.041
Just the way you are Aradhya

01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:59.916
Waltzing towards you

01:21:00.666 --> 01:21:04.375
The gait is yours

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:08.333
The body draped itself

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:11.916
Take hold of it

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.083
Heartfelt thoughts
My beloved star!

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.750
You plundered my heart

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:22.583
And looted the sandalwood beneath

01:21:23.708 --> 01:21:25.583
-Amidst a multitude of festivals
-Hi, Viplav!

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:27.541
Viplav, I will get you some coffee.

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:32.791
Aradhya… Aradhya…

01:21:33.125 --> 01:21:37.333
Seek nothing else but you

01:21:37.541 --> 01:21:41.708
Aradhya… Aradhya…

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.791
Seek nothing else but you

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:35.166
Let my song reach you now

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:38.416
While this game of neck embrace is on

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:43.875
Who wins at the last

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:47.208
Is not clear to us

01:22:48.708 --> 01:22:55.666
This moment… should last…

01:22:57.375 --> 01:23:00.000
With you

01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:05.875
which knows no bounds or shore!

01:23:06.458 --> 01:23:10.791
Aradhya… Aradhya…

01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:14.875
I seek nothing else but you

01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:19.458
Aradhya… Aradhya…

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:23.875
I seek nothing else but you

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:55.250
Yearning to say something
And listen to your words

01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:58.583
At every turn of your imagination

01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:04.125
What's within my grasp
Is what I adore a lot

01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:07.250
Thanks to your loving provocations

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:12.833
Just like you

01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:15.708
I'm transformed…

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.291
I must say

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:26.000
Can't see you and I as different

01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:28.291
Heartfelt thoughts
My beloved star!

01:24:28.375 --> 01:24:30.875
You plundered my heart

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:33.791
And looted the sandalwood beneath

01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:39.750
Amidst a multitude of festivals
The full moonlight shines through

01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:43.958
Aradhya… Aradhya…

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:48.250
I seek nothing else but you

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:52.833
Aradhya… Aradhya…

01:24:53.125 --> 01:24:57.208
I seek nothing else but you

01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:24.375
Okay?

01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:34.791
I need a baby Aradhya.

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:39.500
With the same features.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.541
No, not with my nose. I like your nose.

01:26:43.416 --> 01:26:44.416
She should resemble you…

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:47.500
She should be as tall as me
and should be brainy like me.

01:26:50.375 --> 01:26:52.166
If she's as tall as you, it's difficult
to get a boy for marriage.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.041
Boys are bad!

01:26:56.583 --> 01:26:58.250
I won't let anyone of them get near her.

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.000
Look who's talking!

01:27:01.375 --> 01:27:02.541
She'll always be with us.

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:09.916
Hi.

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:12.416
Doctor, how's the baby?

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.750
Does she bear the same
features as Aradhya?

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:17.666
We can't say that now.

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:19.208
Why are you whispering, doctor?

01:27:19.291 --> 01:27:21.666
Say it aloud! Everyone in Kakinada
should also come to know about it.

01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:22.791
Kanna!

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:27.208
Dear, such things are common
in a seven-week pregnancy.

01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:29.041
What's common, doctor?

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.625
Don't make me tense.
Just tell me what's wrong.

01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:33.708
It's a miscarriage.

01:27:39.083 --> 01:27:40.333
Baby's heart is not beating.

01:27:43.708 --> 01:27:47.875
Is there a history of any
miscarriage in your family?

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.333
But the pregnancy kit
shows that she is pregnant.

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:56.375
The pregnancy kit claims it
but the scan shows the actual report.

01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:59.416
-Is your scanning machine working?
-Of course!

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:03.541
Hey, Aradhya.

01:28:04.416 --> 01:28:05.833
Don't cry.

01:28:07.333 --> 01:28:09.291
We can still go to
better hospitals.

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:12.208
We'll get another opinion
from better doctors.

01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:14.916
-Excuse me.
-Please don't cry.

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:17.958
You'll get the same reports everywhere.

01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:19.791
We have to for MTP.

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:23.041
-MTP means?
-It's a cleaning procedure.

01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:35.416
It's a good time to sign the documents.

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:37.041
You will be settled for life.

01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:42.208
Hello, who is this?

01:28:42.666 --> 01:28:43.583
Mr. Shanmukh.

01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:47.291
You're going to become an uncle
to Viplav's soon-to-be-born child.

01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:51.625
So, tell your uncle
to junk the horoscopes.

01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:53.291
Okay? Bless you.

01:28:55.875 --> 01:28:56.875
Dude…

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.250
-In one year…
-RK!

01:29:01.541 --> 01:29:03.458
What happened, dude?
Why are you so dull, sister?

01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:08.166
RK, do we need kids so soon?

01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:11.333
It's been only a year.

01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:15.458
We have so much more to do in life.

01:29:17.583 --> 01:29:19.458
Don't we both need our personal space?

01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:23.750
Luckily, the doctor said that she's
not pregnant.

01:29:23.916 --> 01:29:24.750
What?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.458
What about the sweets?

01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:30.041
Distribute to everyone.

01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:32.916
Does he want me to distribute it?

01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:38.916
Viplav, all this happened because
we didn't do that oblation.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.333
Aradhya, didn't the doctor
say this is quite normal?

01:29:43.541 --> 01:29:44.791
That's not a problem.

01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:48.458
Shall I tell you something?

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:52.875
This is the time to be strong.
Everything will be fine. Okay?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:05.875
Uncle…

01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:10.750
Aradhya is pregnant.

01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:15.083
Did you hear the news?
Aradhya is pregnant.

01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:20.750
Didn't you tell us that the defect in
their horoscope will not get her pregnant?

01:30:21.625 --> 01:30:23.791
In less than a year, they
proved your shastras wrong.

01:30:24.208 --> 01:30:26.291
How do we face that Satyam now?

01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:31.250
I was shocked when I heard about
Aradhya's pregnancy!

01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:32.416
Just shut up.

01:30:34.708 --> 01:30:36.541
There's no end to your horrible talk.

01:30:37.416 --> 01:30:40.500
Shame on you to wish
ill for your niece like that.

01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:46.416
The horoscope cannot dictate the
destiny that can be altered by the self.

01:30:47.416 --> 01:30:50.666
Aradhya is lucky.
Let's go see her once, Pandu.

01:30:54.875 --> 01:31:00.000
If her mother were alive, she
would have rushed immediately.

01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:05.250
Let's go, son.

01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:14.541
What's the matter?

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:19.625
I can't stop thinking about it, Thomas.

01:31:20.833 --> 01:31:24.375
My feet trembled when
the doctor broke the news.

01:31:25.541 --> 01:31:26.875
It blanked me out.

01:31:30.125 --> 01:31:33.083
Zoya and I didn't want
to have kids for two years.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.458
Later, Lissy was born.

01:31:37.041 --> 01:31:41.041
But those two years were
the best time of our lives!

01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:43.291
Put it.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.958
You are still recently married.

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:58.291
You must enjoy every
moment of your lives.

01:31:58.375 --> 01:32:03.625
Otherwise, Viplav will keep
devouring that lemon rice etc.

01:32:03.916 --> 01:32:04.916
That fish.

01:32:09.291 --> 01:32:10.708
One piece of fish.

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:15.416
Thank you.

01:32:44.416 --> 01:32:45.333
Kanna.

01:32:49.208 --> 01:32:51.083
Father? Is everything fine?

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:52.875
How are you, dear?

01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:55.666
I can smell fish curry here!

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.833
You must be careful now, dear.

01:32:58.291 --> 01:33:01.083
You always thought I didn't do enough.

01:33:01.833 --> 01:33:06.000
Well, I convinced your dad to come here!

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:12.250
Uncle, look around!

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.875
There's no photo of any deity
or even a basil plant.

01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:21.333
Look there, they put liquor bottles in the
most auspicious direction of the house.

01:33:21.958 --> 01:33:24.916
He has done it.
He has converted Aradhya like him.

01:33:25.458 --> 01:33:27.458
They have started
eating fish curry as well.

01:33:27.708 --> 01:33:29.583
What a blasphemy!

01:33:29.666 --> 01:33:33.500
Oh, no, Dad. Our neighbors
are from Bheemavaram.

01:33:33.583 --> 01:33:34.916
They cook fish day and night.

01:33:35.875 --> 01:33:37.583
Did you see how she covered it up?

01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:40.833
He saw it.

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.875
Why don't you freshen up, Dad?

01:33:48.916 --> 01:33:50.708
Where's the marriage photo?

01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:59.666
My dear!

01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:00.958
Come to me.

01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:07.416
-Hey, RK, what are you doing here?
-Your dad is here.

01:34:08.166 --> 01:34:09.166
-My dad?
-Yes.

01:34:11.291 --> 01:34:12.125
Why?

01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:14.791
He wants to congratulate you
on the verge of becoming a dad.

01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:17.000
How did he come to know?

01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:19.666
I couldn't hold the
news and told him, dude.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:21.250
You can't even hold urine for long, man.

01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:22.541
Forget that, dude.

01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:26.083
Even your dad is unable
to contain himself here.

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:28.333
Watch the spectacle!

01:34:36.041 --> 01:34:38.250
-What is this?
-You know your dad better.

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:40.416
-Come on, beat it harder and louder.
-My son is here.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.750
-What is all this, Mom?
-Hey, Viplav.

01:34:41.833 --> 01:34:42.833
You are going to be a dad, right?

01:34:43.958 --> 01:34:45.500
My dear son!

01:34:45.666 --> 01:34:47.375
You kept our flag flying high.

01:34:51.833 --> 01:34:53.083
Well done, Viplav.

01:34:53.458 --> 01:34:56.125
Chadarangam will hang himself
if he comes to know about this news.

01:34:56.583 --> 01:35:00.166
My cute son! I can't believe
you're going to be a dad.

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.583
Even he can't believe it.

01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:02.916
He can't believe it either.

01:35:03.583 --> 01:35:04.416
Look, Viplav.

01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.000
That Chadarangam family

01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:09.416
is capable of rubbing all their
orthodoxy on the unborn child too.

01:35:09.791 --> 01:35:11.333
Stay away from all that.

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:13.625
Don't worry about that, Dad.

01:35:13.916 --> 01:35:15.291
Aradhya is a good girl.

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:18.458
She has even learned to cook
fish curry for me.

01:35:18.708 --> 01:35:21.458
A fish curry by Chadarangam's daughter!

01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:24.958
He's my son!

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:26.333
Really?

01:35:27.208 --> 01:35:28.333
Auntie, you can't believe, right?

01:35:28.416 --> 01:35:30.541
Hey, call Aradhya right now
and put it on the speaker.

01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:32.916
Son, please call your
daughter-in-law once.

01:35:37.833 --> 01:35:39.166
-Viplav!
-Aradhya!

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.125
Mom and dad are coming home, can
you cook fish curry for all of them?

01:35:43.583 --> 01:35:46.583
That's not possible!
Even my dad and mom are here.

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:50.250
I feel numb and can't think
of anything. Where are you?

01:35:50.333 --> 01:35:51.208
Aradhya…

01:35:52.916 --> 01:35:53.791
I am coming, Dad.

01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:55.208
Aradhya!

01:35:57.458 --> 01:35:58.291
Got him!

01:35:59.541 --> 01:36:00.625
Pandu…

01:36:01.916 --> 01:36:05.833
we're fortunate that Aradhya
is following our traditions.

01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:08.500
Why don't you talk to her?

01:36:08.791 --> 01:36:10.250
Just go and speak to her.

01:36:11.125 --> 01:36:12.000
Pandu.

01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:14.875
Talk to her.

01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:18.625
-Hello, Mr. Chadarangam.
-Greetings.

01:36:20.458 --> 01:36:22.541
-A great man said…
-How are you?

01:36:22.625 --> 01:36:26.291
that you must do
oblations to beget children

01:36:27.208 --> 01:36:31.541
and some nonsense about cows etc.

01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:34.166
Now Viplav and Aradhya are soon

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.458
going to be parents
without any of these rituals.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.000
Mr. Chadarangam.

01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:42.791
There is a science behind
an apple falling from the tree.

01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:44.833
It's called the law of gravity!

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:48.041
There is a science
behind a woman conceiving.

01:36:48.125 --> 01:36:49.666
It's called the reproductive science.

01:36:50.291 --> 01:36:53.875
It is something not ordained by
Gods or the shastras you believe in.

01:36:54.458 --> 01:36:57.000
Admit defeat if you
have any iota of shame

01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:59.916
and stay away from the to-be-born child.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.791
Sir, he was just joking--

01:37:03.333 --> 01:37:06.666
Otherwise, wipe that
sacred ash and be like us.

01:37:07.541 --> 01:37:09.166
-Uncle…
-Let me finish.

01:37:09.416 --> 01:37:10.541
-Uncle, that's not right.
-Ara…

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:17.041
It's a miscarriage.

01:37:21.125 --> 01:37:23.125
What? Oh, no!

01:37:26.041 --> 01:37:27.041
What, dear?

01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:31.291
What are you saying?

01:37:31.375 --> 01:37:32.875
The fetus couldn't survive, Grandma!

01:37:33.791 --> 01:37:35.958
My dear!
Oh, my dear!

01:37:42.583 --> 01:37:43.458
Mr. Satyam…

01:37:45.416 --> 01:37:48.583
You said something a while ago.
Science, my foot!

01:37:50.708 --> 01:37:52.791
That there's a science
behind an apple falling…

01:37:54.208 --> 01:37:56.500
and that there's a science
behind a healthy baby's birth.

01:37:58.416 --> 01:38:01.833
But nothing happens without
the five elements of nature.

01:38:03.875 --> 01:38:05.541
Science is born out of creation.

01:38:06.875 --> 01:38:08.750
Creation is not born out of science.

01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:12.541
-Look--
-Folks like you won't get it. Leave it.

01:38:24.291 --> 01:38:26.458
You will only conceive if
an oblation is performed.

01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:30.375
I am saying this as your well-wisher dad…

01:38:32.208 --> 01:38:34.583
and not as Chadarangam Srinivasa Rao.

01:38:50.083 --> 01:38:51.250
Let me console him, Uncle.

01:38:51.541 --> 01:38:52.666
Come…

01:38:53.375 --> 01:38:54.541
Take care of her.

01:39:08.333 --> 01:39:09.166
Kanna!

01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:12.000
Why did you rush to tell them the truth?

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.958
You could have withheld for a day.

01:39:16.416 --> 01:39:19.083
-Are you angry with me?
-Not that, Aradhya.

01:39:21.833 --> 01:39:24.250
Use your brains, sometimes.
You can't get emotional all the time.

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:28.000
Kanna, just listen to me--

01:39:52.208 --> 01:39:53.125
Did you notice?

01:39:54.416 --> 01:39:56.916
Yesterday was the first night
we missed having it.

01:39:59.958 --> 01:40:00.958
You're looking fresh, baby.

01:40:02.708 --> 01:40:03.708
What do you mean?

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:06.583
I've been crying the whole night, Viplav.

01:40:06.791 --> 01:40:07.750
What happened, dear?

01:40:09.791 --> 01:40:11.208
Why did you slam the door on me?

01:40:12.083 --> 01:40:14.083
I didn't slam the door on you.

01:40:15.041 --> 01:40:16.708
I let it slide slowly.

01:40:17.083 --> 01:40:18.166
I am speaking--

01:40:19.708 --> 01:40:22.166
-You deliberately did it.
-Hey, Aradhya, I mean it.

01:40:24.166 --> 01:40:27.791
Why didn't you utter a word when
your dad verbally abused my dad?

01:40:29.583 --> 01:40:31.875
Well, didn't we decide
not to take any sides?

01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:36.041
Being silent also
tantamount to taking sides.

01:40:36.666 --> 01:40:38.666
You were sleeping like a log.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.458
What if I had taken an extreme step?

01:40:41.625 --> 01:40:43.041
What if I had taken an extreme step?

01:40:43.125 --> 01:40:44.750
Aradhya, why are you getting worked up?

01:40:45.666 --> 01:40:47.750
You don't know what happened, ma'am.

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.500
Ma'am, we want to stay
away from both the sides.

01:40:51.041 --> 01:40:53.041
How can I scold my dad
in front of her dad?

01:40:53.250 --> 01:40:54.583
I didn't ask you to scold him.

01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:56.708
I said you could've stopped.

01:40:58.166 --> 01:40:59.500
Well, you stopped it
all by telling the truth.

01:41:00.708 --> 01:41:02.250
As if you never lied to anyone.

01:41:02.416 --> 01:41:03.916
What did I lie?

01:41:04.583 --> 01:41:05.541
Forget it now.

01:41:07.166 --> 01:41:08.208
It's okay, tell me.

01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:10.083
When did I lie to you?

01:41:11.041 --> 01:41:11.916
Pakistan.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.833
Feroze.

01:41:14.916 --> 01:41:15.750
Terrorist camp.

01:41:17.083 --> 01:41:18.416
She has lied to me as well, ma'am.

01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:22.041
I was large-hearted
enough to accommodate her.

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.583
Stop it, Viplav.

01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:27.083
Let's discuss later.
It's getting late for office.

01:41:27.166 --> 01:41:28.750
Yes, I told all lies.

01:41:30.458 --> 01:41:34.500
I should have also lied that I didn't love
you, would have saved all this labor.

01:41:37.166 --> 01:41:40.125
I deserve this for
leaving everything for you.

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.291
Why are you behaving like a kid?

01:41:42.666 --> 01:41:47.250
Is it right for you to intrude when wife
and husband are arguing?

01:41:49.166 --> 01:41:50.000
Hey…

01:41:51.125 --> 01:41:52.625
why are you venting out on her?

01:41:53.791 --> 01:41:54.625
You calm down.

01:41:54.833 --> 01:41:55.666
Apologize to her.

01:41:55.916 --> 01:41:57.166
Why should she say sorry to me?

01:41:57.708 --> 01:42:00.125
Don't bother, dear.
Let's go to office now.

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.208
Please apologize to her, Aradhya.

01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:10.791
Sorry, ma'am.

01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:16.625
Viplav…

01:42:24.458 --> 01:42:27.708
Aradhya is a girl with self-esteem.
She is hurt for sure.

01:42:27.916 --> 01:42:30.125
Let it be, ma'am.
Nothing will happen.

01:42:30.375 --> 01:42:32.416
She said she erred in trusting you.

01:42:32.666 --> 01:42:34.166
That's an uneasy
feeling for any girl to get.

01:42:34.375 --> 01:42:36.916
Ma'am, we should
keep them in their limits.

01:42:37.625 --> 01:42:38.833
Hey, stop.

01:42:40.125 --> 01:42:41.000
What happened, ma'am?

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:42.333
Get down.

01:42:43.958 --> 01:42:44.791
What did you say?

01:42:44.875 --> 01:42:47.875
We should keep them in their limits.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.458
That applies to all the women, right?

01:42:50.958 --> 01:42:56.083
That coconut seller, Aradhya,
myself, everyone, right?

01:42:56.333 --> 01:42:58.500
What is the connection with
that coconut seller, ma'am?

01:42:58.583 --> 01:42:59.500
Well, didn't you just say it?

01:43:00.083 --> 01:43:02.750
Why do you paint every
woman with the same brush?

01:43:03.708 --> 01:43:05.375
You're just like any other male.

01:43:06.375 --> 01:43:07.208
Do one thing.

01:43:07.916 --> 01:43:09.291
Walk to the office.

01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:10.916
Ma'am.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.750
Yes, just think about what you said.

01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:16.125
Ma'am.

01:43:16.416 --> 01:43:17.666
Don't leave me here, ma'am.

01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:27.041
Why is Aradhya doing this?

01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:30.666
The moment I stepped in…

01:43:31.208 --> 01:43:34.875
she said I slammed the door on her,
and she feels like committing suicide.

01:43:35.583 --> 01:43:37.875
Even I am outside that door now.

01:43:38.333 --> 01:43:39.583
What if I also commit suicide?

01:43:40.083 --> 01:43:41.708
Marriage itself means
writing our own obituary.

01:43:41.875 --> 01:43:44.458
You are a dead meat. RIP…

01:43:44.541 --> 01:43:45.750
Sir, shall I squeeze a lemon?

01:43:45.833 --> 01:43:47.916
Who asked you to barge in like this?

01:43:48.916 --> 01:43:51.750
We're talking about something important.
Get the hell out of here.

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:52.791
Keep them here and go.

01:43:55.125 --> 01:43:56.625
You should always be kept in your limits.

01:43:56.875 --> 01:43:57.833
You…

01:43:58.458 --> 01:43:59.375
Have you got any shame?

01:44:00.458 --> 01:44:02.875
Why do you talk like a male chauvinist?

01:44:03.625 --> 01:44:04.458
How do we treat women then?

01:44:06.083 --> 01:44:07.375
You should think highly of them, RK!

01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:09.125
Oh.

01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:12.041
Ma'am. Sorry. Please don't mind.

01:44:12.666 --> 01:44:13.666
Please squeeze a lemon.

01:44:14.875 --> 01:44:16.000
Squeeze one for him first.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Hey, wait!

01:44:26.416 --> 01:44:28.291
-Wait!
-How many glasses will you break?

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:31.208
Why are you scared so much?

01:44:31.916 --> 01:44:33.000
Relax. Come.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.333
What do you think about me?

01:44:37.625 --> 01:44:39.666
People may have their opinions about me.

01:44:40.208 --> 01:44:41.416
But I am a feminist at heart.

01:44:42.708 --> 01:44:44.583
Please sit.

01:44:45.583 --> 01:44:46.416
Sit down.

01:44:51.875 --> 01:44:52.791
Clean yourself.

01:44:56.083 --> 01:44:57.875
Poor Aradhya. I can empathize
how she must be feeling.

01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:04.333
I just wanted to draw her
closer, hug her and say sorry.

01:45:05.166 --> 01:45:07.083
You can still do that.

01:45:07.583 --> 01:45:09.375
Just imagine our maid Lakshmi
to be Aradhya for a moment.

01:45:09.458 --> 01:45:10.541
You can hug her and show your emotions.

01:45:10.625 --> 01:45:12.083
-I will also show my emotions.
-Dirty fellow!

01:45:13.666 --> 01:45:15.041
Aradhya is the only woman
I have in my life.

01:45:16.083 --> 01:45:17.458
Nobody else.

01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:18.416
Okay, sir.

01:45:21.625 --> 01:45:23.500
I can't stand these night shifts.

01:45:24.541 --> 01:45:27.208
What are you wearing for
tomorrow's kick-off party?

01:45:28.208 --> 01:45:29.958
I am not in the mood for it.

01:45:33.833 --> 01:45:35.166
Hey, there's your husband!

01:45:36.666 --> 01:45:37.958
Look, there.

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:48.458
Aradhya!

01:45:48.666 --> 01:45:49.541
Aradhya!

01:45:59.416 --> 01:46:00.291
Baby.

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:03.291
Look at your eyes.
They are restless.

01:46:03.458 --> 01:46:04.625
I am going to give up these night shifts.

01:46:04.708 --> 01:46:05.541
Hold this.

01:46:07.958 --> 01:46:08.791
Have this coffee.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.416
I made it.

01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:18.000
Baby! Hey!

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.625
Baby, have it. Please.

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:24.375
Dear, do you know him?

01:46:25.208 --> 01:46:26.750
-Yes.
-No.

01:46:27.416 --> 01:46:29.250
-Is this what you do?
-Baby…

01:46:29.458 --> 01:46:31.083
No, Auntie.
I know her.

01:46:31.166 --> 01:46:32.625
Move out. Go and stand over there.

01:46:33.041 --> 01:46:34.541
-Baby, tell her.
-Move.

01:46:35.375 --> 01:46:37.083
-Move.
-Here… Leave.

01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:38.458
Baby, what's happening?

01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:53.458
If you hadn't caught the ball,
we would have lost the game.

01:46:54.250 --> 01:46:57.500
We won it because Appu
hit a six off the last ball.

01:46:58.583 --> 01:47:00.291
-Girl, shall I play? I play well.
-Hey!

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:01.833
I bet you'll like what I play. Listen…

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:03.208
And he wants to bowl.

01:47:03.333 --> 01:47:05.583
What else do we need?

01:47:06.458 --> 01:47:09.083
Enough
That's enough

01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:12.875
What else do we need?

01:47:13.083 --> 01:47:15.833
Enough
That's enough

01:47:15.916 --> 01:47:16.750
Hey, give it back.

01:47:17.208 --> 01:47:18.541
Do you want me to call the police?

01:47:19.375 --> 01:47:21.250
Hey, the teacher is upset.

01:47:22.833 --> 01:47:25.166
Guys, it's finals tomorrow.
Let's be serious about it.

01:47:25.250 --> 01:47:27.375
Hey, Delhi! She's the
girl from our colony.

01:47:27.958 --> 01:47:29.083
Remember the one at the medical shop?

01:47:30.166 --> 01:47:32.416
She's trying hard for
kids for over a year now.

01:47:34.375 --> 01:47:35.250
Baby…

01:47:36.666 --> 01:47:37.916
you're tender like a baby.

01:47:38.208 --> 01:47:39.708
Do you still need babies?

01:47:46.916 --> 01:47:47.791
Hi.

01:47:48.375 --> 01:47:49.208
Dilip!

01:47:50.833 --> 01:47:52.125
Why don't you give me a chance?

01:47:52.458 --> 01:47:53.708
-I will fulfill your wish.
-Hey.

01:47:55.125 --> 01:47:57.083
I've helped many aunties get pregnant.

01:47:57.833 --> 01:47:58.875
I can assist you as well.

01:47:59.458 --> 01:48:01.791
You can trust me.
Just give me a chance.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.458
Please! Just give me a chance.

01:48:15.625 --> 01:48:16.458
Delhi!

01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:17.583
Delhi!

01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:18.666
Delhi!

01:48:25.458 --> 01:48:26.333
Hey!

01:48:28.541 --> 01:48:33.208
If a lady wears a nuptial chain and
toe-rings, then it means she is married.

01:48:34.375 --> 01:48:36.166
It's your bad luck that you messed
with her right in front of her husband.

01:48:39.333 --> 01:48:40.291
That's me.

01:49:29.458 --> 01:49:31.333
Hey, if I hit, it will be a six for sure!

01:49:31.625 --> 01:49:32.458
-Got it?
-Hey!

01:49:32.625 --> 01:49:33.625
-Go and hit it then!
-Teacher!

01:49:34.125 --> 01:49:36.625
Hey, I am the best player
from Begumpet!

01:49:36.708 --> 01:49:37.791
-Hit him, go on.
-Teacher!

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.041
What else do we want?

01:50:11.666 --> 01:50:12.541
We want nothing more, sir.

01:50:12.875 --> 01:50:13.791
Out!

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:16.208
We smashed it at the ground.
And now we got smashed here.

01:50:18.833 --> 01:50:19.791
Sorry, bro.

01:50:30.625 --> 01:50:31.500
Kanna!

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:33.250
Baby, Sorry.

01:50:35.166 --> 01:50:36.875
We didn't talk for two days.

01:50:37.166 --> 01:50:38.875
I won't leave you until you talk to me.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:40.833
Kanna!

01:50:41.875 --> 01:50:45.625
I feel these rifts are because of
the defects my dad pointed out.

01:50:45.708 --> 01:50:48.125
What are you saying?
I don't think so.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:50.916
What about miscarriage?

01:50:51.666 --> 01:50:52.791
That's a medical condition.

01:50:53.083 --> 01:50:54.958
Didn't the doctor say that
it is quite common?

01:50:55.583 --> 01:50:56.500
What about the fight on the terrace?

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:59.125
Oh, that's not a fight, Ara.

01:50:59.541 --> 01:51:01.500
It's a miscommunication.

01:51:04.833 --> 01:51:07.208
You will now see a different side of me.

01:51:08.125 --> 01:51:09.750
Nothing will crop up between us.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.041
Don't you believe me?

01:51:17.291 --> 01:51:18.250
Okay.

01:51:19.083 --> 01:51:24.083
The world will see how good
a husband I am for the next 24 hours.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:29.916
Kanna!

01:51:31.583 --> 01:51:32.541
Let's both get tested.

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.750
If there's some issue, we will fix it.

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.208
Else, as my dad said…

01:51:41.291 --> 01:51:42.500
Why talk about your dad?

01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:46.000
You want to get tested, right?

01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:49.208
Aradhya will take rest…

01:51:50.166 --> 01:51:51.041
and Kanna will work.

01:51:51.958 --> 01:51:52.833
Fix it!

01:51:59.083 --> 01:52:00.000
Love you Kanna.

01:52:06.333 --> 01:52:07.250
Isn't the doctor here?

01:52:12.708 --> 01:52:14.041
Hello, brother.

01:52:15.791 --> 01:52:17.041
My friend, Viplav is a fresher.

01:52:17.791 --> 01:52:18.916
Five years seniority.

01:52:20.875 --> 01:52:21.791
You…

01:52:22.166 --> 01:52:23.458
Why are you calling me out by name?

01:52:24.833 --> 01:52:26.041
I will leave if you do all this.

01:52:26.125 --> 01:52:27.250
Hey, just sit down, dude.

01:52:27.458 --> 01:52:30.541
We're meeting Dappu Subhani,
the best sexologist in Bhongir.

01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:34.041
But what's a Sexologist
doing in a fertility clinic?

01:52:34.125 --> 01:52:37.000
There are deadly stories about him, dude!

01:52:37.208 --> 01:52:39.458
But why are you embarrassing me, dude?

01:52:39.916 --> 01:52:41.125
Keep quiet, bro.

01:52:41.958 --> 01:52:43.333
I don't doubt my abilities.

01:52:43.833 --> 01:52:45.208
I came here because of Aradhya.

01:52:45.875 --> 01:52:46.958
Sit down, dude. Nothing to worry.

01:52:50.666 --> 01:52:51.708
Thank you so much, dear!

01:52:51.833 --> 01:52:53.250
Let's go.

01:52:55.333 --> 01:52:56.166
Fill it to the brim.

01:52:56.250 --> 01:52:57.500
Fill it to the brim…

01:53:01.833 --> 01:53:03.875
Hey! What happened?

01:53:04.041 --> 01:53:05.250
Why are so many people here?

01:53:05.375 --> 01:53:06.583
Doctor is quite famous.

01:53:06.666 --> 01:53:07.708
Hey, get lost!

01:53:07.875 --> 01:53:09.833
Hey, I'll handle it. Come here.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:10.958
Uncle, move aside please.

01:53:11.041 --> 01:53:12.708
-Why are you barging in like that?
-We are from the department, Uncle.

01:53:12.791 --> 01:53:14.250
Which department?
How can you jump the queue?

01:53:14.333 --> 01:53:15.625
We were ahead of you.

01:53:15.791 --> 01:53:17.166
Uncle, my friend is from BSNL.

01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:18.541
He came all the way from Chikkadpally.

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:20.458
-Move…
-Don't tell much about me.

01:53:20.541 --> 01:53:22.083
So, what? I've shut
my vegetable shop as well!

01:53:22.166 --> 01:53:24.125
Then what are you doing here?
Get out of here.

01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:25.708
I am going through the same problem.

01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:27.000
Try to understand, uncle.

01:53:27.083 --> 01:53:29.000
What do you want us to understand?

01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:30.708
-What are you talking?
-What do you want us to understand?

01:53:30.833 --> 01:53:32.958
-Don't we have anything else to do?
-He won't take long.

01:53:33.041 --> 01:53:34.166
Hey!

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:36.958
Hey, I am Viplav.

01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:38.791
A BSNL employee.

01:53:40.041 --> 01:53:42.083
Just wait for two minutes.
Let me fill it and come out.

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.666
-What nonsense is this?
-How can you let him go inside?

01:53:45.916 --> 01:53:47.000
Fill it to the brim, dude.

01:53:48.541 --> 01:53:49.916
For ten years of our company.

01:53:50.416 --> 01:53:51.291
Aradhya.

01:53:51.625 --> 01:53:53.250
I am so impressed with your work.

01:53:53.916 --> 01:53:55.333
You are a big support for me.

01:53:55.791 --> 01:53:56.750
Thank you, Michael.

01:53:57.125 --> 01:53:58.458
Hey, let me advise you.

01:53:58.708 --> 01:54:01.625
Whatever happens in life,
never miss a party, dude.

01:54:01.791 --> 01:54:03.208
Okay? Just chill.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.291
-Aradhya.
-Hey!

01:54:07.083 --> 01:54:07.916
Are you married?

01:54:09.250 --> 01:54:10.125
Of course! Yes.

01:54:10.833 --> 01:54:11.875
That's a bad news for me.

01:54:12.708 --> 01:54:14.375
Otherwise, I would've married you.

01:54:15.166 --> 01:54:16.000
-Do you want to marry him?
-That's okay.

01:54:17.041 --> 01:54:19.000
Anyone can easily fall in love with you.

01:54:19.166 --> 01:54:20.791
Hey, what happened?

01:54:22.541 --> 01:54:25.541
That white fellow says
he will marry her if she was single.

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:29.250
Why is she cool about it
instead of giving him a tight slap?

01:54:31.875 --> 01:54:32.958
I can't bear all this.
Let me go home.

01:54:33.041 --> 01:54:33.916
Hey, dude.

01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:36.625
The drinks are on the house.
Let's have some pegs and leave.

01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:38.708
-Hey, I am leaving.
-Just two pegs, dude.

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.208
One peg for you… two pegs for me.

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:42.333
-Hey, no. Let's go.
-Hey.

01:54:42.416 --> 01:54:43.291
Viplav…

01:54:43.958 --> 01:54:45.875
-Hi.
-Let me introduce my client. Come.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.333
No need.

01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:48.625
-Are you okay?
-Go.

01:54:49.875 --> 01:54:50.750
What happened to the test?

01:54:54.541 --> 01:54:56.083
He must have failed the test.

01:54:56.458 --> 01:54:58.583
He's surely down now.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.833
Guys are very sensitive on these matters.

01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:02.666
Don't ask him now, Aradhya.

01:55:02.875 --> 01:55:05.625
You can discuss at home.

01:55:06.625 --> 01:55:07.458
Come.

01:55:07.833 --> 01:55:08.666
Be it whatever--

01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:11.625
Aradhya, my uncle is a
famous doctor in Australia.

01:55:12.250 --> 01:55:15.166
He has treated men
aged over 50 for infertility.

01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:17.333
Let's consult him for Viplav.

01:55:20.041 --> 01:55:21.958
I know a saint from Berhampur.

01:55:22.208 --> 01:55:23.625
Let's take Viplav there.

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:25.583
How do all of them know about it?
Did you tell them?

01:55:25.833 --> 01:55:27.041
Why will I tell them?

01:55:27.208 --> 01:55:29.208
I thought he is a powerhouse.

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.083
Oh my God!

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.500
I'm going to kill myself.

01:55:33.666 --> 01:55:35.375
-Hey, what happened now?
-I'm going to die.

01:55:35.625 --> 01:55:38.875
Why is she telling everybody
about my personal issues?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.208
Bloody hell! These wives can't
keep anything to themselves.

01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:43.416
Hey, stop it. Are you crazy?

01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:46.125
Make an announcement.

01:55:46.208 --> 01:55:47.458
Announce it.

01:55:57.625 --> 01:55:59.125
Greetings to everyone.

01:56:02.875 --> 01:56:04.916
A humble request to all the folks here

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.958
who are agog with discussions
about my virulence and manliness.

01:56:09.916 --> 01:56:12.458
I just got the lab test results.

01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:15.666
I've got the certificate
about my virulence.

01:56:17.666 --> 01:56:21.583
But my wife is spreading
fake stories to defame me.

01:56:23.333 --> 01:56:24.958
Let me now share a story about my--

01:56:25.583 --> 01:56:26.416
Sorry.

01:56:27.458 --> 01:56:30.666
I mean, wives in general.

01:56:30.875 --> 01:56:31.708
Just listen to me.

01:56:44.416 --> 01:56:45.333
Hey!

01:56:50.833 --> 01:56:53.750
For the first time I have
Seen her in Kashmir

01:56:53.875 --> 01:56:56.708
Without thinking anything
I started loving her

01:56:56.875 --> 01:56:59.458
Without listening to my
father I came out for her

01:56:59.791 --> 01:57:02.500
Got married to live happily with her

01:57:03.833 --> 01:57:05.666
Then started struggling

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.375
She has changed day by day

01:57:08.458 --> 01:57:09.791
My dear wife

01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:14.208
I became really angry with you

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:15.791
Please stop dear

01:57:17.416 --> 01:57:19.708
I am struggling like cuckoo
Before the butcher killing it

01:57:20.791 --> 01:57:23.625
Listen everybody
Let me tell you something

01:57:23.708 --> 01:57:26.458
Don't even dream to get married

01:57:26.791 --> 01:57:31.500
Wife is powerful than gun
She will get you pissed

01:57:32.875 --> 01:57:35.583
Listen every body
Let me tell you something

01:57:35.666 --> 01:57:38.708
Don't even dream to get married

01:57:38.875 --> 01:57:43.500
Wife is powerful than gun
She will get you pissed

01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:11.500
They won't open the door
When we go home late

01:58:11.833 --> 01:58:14.458
If we drink with friends
They will peel off the skin with words

01:58:14.875 --> 01:58:17.458
They always keeps eye on ex-girlfriend

01:58:17.875 --> 01:58:20.375
They can track their husbands

01:58:20.708 --> 01:58:23.500
They are they pamper you with nick names

01:58:23.875 --> 01:58:26.458
They will tell husband
Is more than her family

01:58:26.791 --> 01:58:29.500
If we speak one word against them

01:58:29.833 --> 01:58:32.541
They will bite with tears

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.666
Wife became a knife

01:58:36.958 --> 01:58:38.541
My mind is blocked

01:58:39.958 --> 01:58:41.625
Life has changed

01:58:42.958 --> 01:58:45.250
My fate has burnt to ashes

01:58:59.833 --> 01:59:04.208
Wives are ghosts

01:59:05.833 --> 01:59:10.208
Ghosts are wives

01:59:11.791 --> 01:59:14.666
Wives… you are not good wives

01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:17.500
Ghosts… you are all ghosts

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:18.916
My dear wife

01:59:20.333 --> 01:59:23.250
I became really angry with you

01:59:23.416 --> 01:59:24.875
Please stop

01:59:26.375 --> 01:59:29.208
I became a cuckoo in front of you

01:59:29.875 --> 01:59:32.583
Listen every body Let
me tell you something

01:59:32.666 --> 01:59:35.625
Don't even dream to get married

01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:40.375
Wife is powerful than
gun She will get you pissed

01:59:41.791 --> 01:59:44.666
Listen every body Let
me tell you something

01:59:44.791 --> 01:59:47.666
Don't even dream to get married

01:59:47.791 --> 01:59:52.541
Wife is powerful than
gun She will get you pissed

02:00:23.625 --> 02:00:26.000
We've a fight in less than 24 hours.

02:00:26.791 --> 02:00:27.916
Who said couples don't fight?

02:00:29.125 --> 02:00:30.500
Couples always fight.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.291
If both of us don't have a
problem, then where's the problem?

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.041
You tell me about it.

02:00:40.583 --> 02:00:42.958
As my dad foretold, the problem
lies in that horoscope defect.

02:00:43.541 --> 02:00:47.416
All this is because you
haven't done that oblation yet.

02:00:47.541 --> 02:00:48.458
Aradhya…

02:00:49.583 --> 02:00:51.583
my dad has an image
to live up to in society.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.666
I can't make him do all these rituals.

02:00:57.708 --> 02:00:59.666
Please give some time.
Everything will get sorted.

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.291
Nothing will change for years, Viplav.

02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:05.125
Do you remember that one day
we were talking about miscarriage

02:01:05.375 --> 02:01:07.250
at traffic signal

02:01:07.333 --> 02:01:09.833
and a saint threw holy ash
and said the same thing.

02:01:09.916 --> 02:01:10.791
So?

02:01:11.375 --> 02:01:13.625
Everyone is trying to
nudge us to do the oblation.

02:01:13.875 --> 02:01:14.708
Hey!

02:01:15.833 --> 02:01:16.666
Have you gone mad?

02:01:17.375 --> 02:01:18.583
Why do you talk as if
you're possessed by a devil?

02:01:18.666 --> 02:01:21.333
So, you trust the devil but can't
seem to believe in God!

02:01:21.416 --> 02:01:22.750
Oh, Aradhya. Just leave me alone. Please.

02:01:24.708 --> 02:01:25.875
So, do you want me to walk out?

02:01:25.958 --> 02:01:27.500
No, I am asking you to
leave me now!

02:01:27.708 --> 02:01:29.041
Let me go to sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:43.375
Have something.

02:01:45.791 --> 02:01:46.916
Did you guys fight again?

02:01:49.833 --> 02:01:51.625
It's Lissy's birthday in two days.

02:01:52.583 --> 02:01:54.250
Thomas and I are going to Alleppey.

02:01:55.458 --> 02:01:56.583
It's a beautiful place.

02:01:57.958 --> 02:02:00.041
You and Aradhya need a change.

02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:01.833
Both of you can come with us.

02:02:02.333 --> 02:02:03.166
Oh, ma'am.

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:04.916
Why Aradhya?

02:02:06.083 --> 02:02:08.791
We don't want to play
spoilsport in your party.

02:02:11.333 --> 02:02:13.875
Don't make excuses, Viplav?
It's my daughter's birthday.

02:02:14.041 --> 02:02:15.041
Please listen to me…

02:02:15.791 --> 02:02:17.416
You are coming with her.

02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:19.958
Okay?

02:02:28.333 --> 02:02:29.791
Ms. Zoya and her
husband left for Alleppey.

02:02:33.666 --> 02:02:35.125
I just dropped them.

02:02:35.791 --> 02:02:36.750
It's Lissy's birthday.

02:02:40.541 --> 02:02:42.416
They also invited us.
It will be nice to go to Kerala.

02:02:47.208 --> 02:02:48.208
Look Aradhya,

02:02:49.083 --> 02:02:52.083
Ms. Zoya has helped us
a lot since our marriage.

02:02:53.250 --> 02:02:54.458
So, drop your ego…

02:02:56.791 --> 02:02:57.625
I mean,

02:02:57.958 --> 02:03:02.166
let's drop our egos and go there.
They will be happy to have us.

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:06.166
Let us not be childish…

02:03:07.041 --> 02:03:08.250
and act more mature.

02:03:23.083 --> 02:03:27.333
You are trying to be away from me

02:03:31.458 --> 02:03:35.375
Blushing away from me

02:03:36.583 --> 02:03:40.333
Sir, Kunjappan boat is the
best boat available in Alleppey.

02:03:40.875 --> 02:03:42.916
If you are in love, you will tie the
knot when you got onto this boat.

02:03:43.083 --> 02:03:45.458
If you are married,
you will have kids here.

02:03:45.791 --> 02:03:47.208
How many kids do you have?

02:03:47.833 --> 02:03:49.208
How many kids, sir?

02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:50.458
How many kids, sir?

02:03:54.708 --> 02:03:56.666
You drive it.

02:03:59.541 --> 02:04:00.416
Go forward.

02:04:10.583 --> 02:04:11.458
Aradhya.

02:04:27.416 --> 02:04:28.416
It's not what you think.

02:04:28.958 --> 02:04:30.083
I am in my monthly cycle.

02:04:31.791 --> 02:04:33.375
We would have canceled
the programme in that case.

02:04:34.541 --> 02:04:36.625
Now, you say that.
But if I said this earlier…

02:04:38.166 --> 02:04:43.041
you would have put labels
on me, as a liar and an egotist.

02:04:43.416 --> 02:04:45.750
Please don't start arguing with me.

02:04:46.666 --> 02:04:48.125
-Am I arguing?
-Obviously!

02:04:49.375 --> 02:04:50.333
All I am saying is that…

02:04:51.291 --> 02:04:53.625
you should have told me before
we started. What's wrong with that?

02:04:54.708 --> 02:04:56.458
Did you really ask me
if I was alright or not?

02:04:56.541 --> 02:04:58.750
Why do you girls turn out like
this after marriage, Aradhya?

02:04:59.541 --> 02:05:00.916
Always fussing about it.

02:05:03.041 --> 02:05:06.625
If you didn't want to spend time with me,
you could've stayed back at home.

02:05:07.375 --> 02:05:08.750
I came here for Ms. Zoya.

02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:11.208
Superb! Thank you.

02:05:12.625 --> 02:05:15.916
Just stay patient for two day for the
sake of Ms. Zoya without fighting!

02:05:16.958 --> 02:05:18.041
Later, you can do what you feel like.

02:05:19.125 --> 02:05:21.583
You can decide if you want to stay with me
or go to your house.

02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:26.375
Let's stay away from
each other for a few days.

02:05:26.541 --> 02:05:27.958
I am not at all at peace.

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:59.875
The moment

02:06:00.458 --> 02:06:02.625
When my heart dissolves

02:06:03.208 --> 02:06:07.208
In your nearness

02:06:08.833 --> 02:06:11.500
Praising your name

02:06:11.625 --> 02:06:14.333
With all my heart

02:06:14.416 --> 02:06:18.500
Is all I want

02:06:20.208 --> 02:06:22.833
Oh Lord

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.583
Who saves this world

02:06:25.666 --> 02:06:29.958
With boundless love

02:06:31.458 --> 02:06:34.000
In your world

02:06:34.208 --> 02:06:36.875
My child's life is

02:06:36.958 --> 02:06:41.208
Sweeter than the elixir

02:06:44.125 --> 02:06:46.625
Let's celebrate Lissy's birthday.

02:06:47.083 --> 02:06:48.458
Happy birthday, Lissy.

02:06:51.958 --> 02:06:53.500
Thank you, Father for the prayer service.

02:06:53.583 --> 02:06:54.666
Come on, let's enjoy.

02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:58.041
Everybody, please enjoy!

02:06:58.625 --> 02:07:01.166
-Viplav! Welcome.
-Hi, Viplav. Aradhya.

02:07:02.166 --> 02:07:04.291
Hey, why are you looking sad, Viplav?

02:07:04.458 --> 02:07:05.833
Don't you know it is
Lissy's birthday today?

02:07:05.916 --> 02:07:07.583
Come, let's enjoy.

02:07:09.125 --> 02:07:11.875
Lissy doesn't like gloomy faces.

02:07:13.916 --> 02:07:15.500
It is Lissy's birthday, Viplav.

02:07:15.708 --> 02:07:17.625
You must have a drink.

02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:19.500
Come on. Cheers.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:20.833
Cheers.

02:07:22.125 --> 02:07:23.000
No!

02:07:30.375 --> 02:07:31.750
What happened to Lissy, ma'am?

02:07:32.875 --> 02:07:35.625
Lissy… Her time's up.

02:07:37.333 --> 02:07:38.291
She's gone.

02:07:49.666 --> 02:07:52.041
I still remember the
day I delivered Lissy.

02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:54.875
She was a premature baby…

02:07:57.500 --> 02:08:01.375
with most features unformed yet.

02:08:05.916 --> 02:08:09.000
When I picked her up,
the doctors warned that…

02:08:10.333 --> 02:08:11.625
she is extremely fragile
and may break her bones.

02:08:14.375 --> 02:08:15.791
My heart sank…

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.458
that very moment.

02:08:22.458 --> 02:08:25.958
All the relatives who saw her
left without saying a word.

02:08:28.583 --> 02:08:30.958
Doctors gave her just six months.

02:08:35.125 --> 02:08:37.125
That was when Thomas patted me…

02:08:38.416 --> 02:08:39.250
and said…

02:08:41.875 --> 02:08:46.625
he will do everything in
his powers to save her life.

02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:51.750
The confidence he gave me…

02:08:53.833 --> 02:08:55.541
helped us save Lissy for five years.

02:09:00.208 --> 02:09:01.833
After that, we didn't want any kids.

02:09:03.291 --> 02:09:04.250
We don't want to…

02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:07.333
trouble another life.

02:09:08.791 --> 02:09:10.250
We just became kids to each other.

02:09:14.375 --> 02:09:17.125
With or without Lissy…

02:09:18.958 --> 02:09:20.458
Thomas stood like a
rock of support for me.

02:09:23.416 --> 02:09:24.750
Thomas is my courage.

02:09:30.666 --> 02:09:31.500
Hey.

02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:39.333
Why talk melancholic

02:09:39.416 --> 02:09:41.375
-when the mood is so upbeat?
-Correct.

02:09:48.708 --> 02:09:49.666
Yes, Viplav.

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:52.041
Backwaters…

02:09:54.041 --> 02:09:54.916
romantic mood…

02:09:56.666 --> 02:09:57.500
Enjoy.

02:09:57.666 --> 02:09:58.833
-Right?
-Yes.

02:09:58.916 --> 02:09:59.875
-Come on.
-Enjoy.

02:10:54.791 --> 02:10:55.625
Aradhya.

02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:09.625
Kunjappan!

02:11:11.833 --> 02:11:12.750
Kunjappan!

02:11:17.083 --> 02:11:17.916
Sir?

02:11:18.083 --> 02:11:19.083
Did you see Aradhya?

02:11:19.416 --> 02:11:20.250
Sir?

02:11:20.583 --> 02:11:21.916
Aradhya? My wife?

02:11:23.166 --> 02:11:24.125
Hey, Johnson!

02:11:24.791 --> 02:11:25.666
What?

02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:27.500
Did you see sir's wife
traveling in a boat?

02:11:28.083 --> 02:11:30.333
Yes, she left a while ago.

02:11:31.083 --> 02:11:33.666
Sir, she left half an hour ago.

02:11:34.666 --> 02:11:36.041
Kunjappan, take the boat out!

02:11:36.791 --> 02:11:39.416
It's difficult to catch up in a boat.
Let's go on the bike.

02:11:55.666 --> 02:11:56.500
Aradhya…

02:11:59.666 --> 02:12:00.500
where are you going?

02:12:04.041 --> 02:12:06.875
As you wanted, I came for Ms. Zoya.

02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:08.708
Now I am leaving.

02:12:10.416 --> 02:12:11.500
Where are you going, Aradhya?

02:12:14.375 --> 02:12:15.208
To my house.

02:12:21.958 --> 02:12:23.708
Okay then, let me also join you.

02:12:24.041 --> 02:12:27.125
Why do you want to come when
you wish to part ways, Viplav?

02:12:28.666 --> 02:12:30.125
What are you talking, Aradhya?

02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:34.166
You don't get what I want.

02:12:36.125 --> 02:12:37.375
When I ask, you shout at me.

02:12:38.916 --> 02:12:41.250
I am scared to even talk to you, Viplav.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:46.916
All this while, I thought

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.625
you had a problem only with
my family and our orthodox ways.

02:12:50.416 --> 02:12:51.583
Ma'am, will you come or not?

02:12:52.916 --> 02:12:55.250
I am your only problem.

02:12:57.666 --> 02:12:58.583
Ara…

02:13:03.250 --> 02:13:09.666
Dear heart

02:13:10.583 --> 02:13:16.500
Biding goodbye to us

02:13:17.958 --> 02:13:23.833
Amidst nostalgic thoughts
Can you feel it?

02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:27.875
The heart is wounded

02:13:28.083 --> 02:13:31.500
Wishing to end life

02:13:32.208 --> 02:13:35.500
Ego is crushing friendship

02:13:35.833 --> 02:13:39.500
Who really owns the other?

02:13:39.625 --> 02:13:46.250
Heart is lost in anxiety
While silent pauses go up

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.125
The tight grip of the past ends

02:13:50.583 --> 02:13:54.375
With a sense of loss of bonding

02:14:31.958 --> 02:14:34.875
You stood by me

02:14:34.958 --> 02:14:38.875
All these days like a loyal shadow

02:14:39.833 --> 02:14:46.125
But now you desire to
Desert me for few days only

02:14:46.625 --> 02:14:50.041
Every thought
In remembrance of you

02:14:50.166 --> 02:14:53.625
Is a meditation in love

02:14:54.041 --> 02:14:57.416
But even a moment of forgetting me

02:14:57.791 --> 02:15:00.708
Makes me pine for you

02:15:00.791 --> 02:15:07.458
The heart is wounded
Wishing to end life

02:15:08.125 --> 02:15:11.250
Ego is crushing friendship

02:15:11.833 --> 02:15:15.541
Who really owns the other?

02:15:22.208 --> 02:15:23.083
Hello!

02:15:27.166 --> 02:15:28.083
Aradhya!

02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:40.125
Hello, Mr. Shanmukham.

02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:43.291
It's common to see fights
between a wife and a husband.

02:15:43.458 --> 02:15:45.125
My friend is pining for Aradhya, sir.

02:15:45.250 --> 02:15:46.916
Please ask her to talk to him once, sir.

02:15:47.083 --> 02:15:48.166
What's there to talk now?

02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:49.625
There is no relationship between them.

02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:51.833
Aradhya herself says it's all over.

02:15:55.541 --> 02:15:57.541
It seems there's nothing between the
both of you. Aradhya herself said it.

02:15:57.833 --> 02:15:59.583
Let's leave.
It's getting late. Let's go.

02:16:03.083 --> 02:16:04.583
I can't stay without her, dude.

02:16:09.625 --> 02:16:16.000
Like a Hibiscus flower
That burns in fire silently

02:16:17.458 --> 02:16:23.791
I will remain with you forever
In your moments of grief

02:16:24.333 --> 02:16:31.125
Whether it's a piercing arrow
Or uneasiness, or a dark vacuum

02:16:31.791 --> 02:16:33.541
A boon from sweetheart

02:16:33.625 --> 02:16:38.333
Or my last breath
Or an ocean of separation between us

02:16:38.416 --> 02:16:41.375
The heart is wounded

02:16:42.208 --> 02:16:45.250
Wishing to end life

02:16:45.791 --> 02:16:49.125
Ego is crushing friendship

02:16:49.541 --> 02:16:53.000
Who really owns the other?

02:16:53.250 --> 02:16:59.833
Heart is lost in anxiety
While silent pauses go up

02:17:00.708 --> 02:17:03.791
The tight grip of the past ends

02:17:04.333 --> 02:17:08.375
With a sense of loss of bonding

02:17:08.708 --> 02:17:15.250
Dear heart

02:17:15.916 --> 02:17:22.333
Biding goodbye to us

02:17:23.375 --> 02:17:29.541
Amidst nostalgic thoughts
Can you feel it?

02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:39.125
The auspicious time needs to be changed.

02:17:39.625 --> 02:17:40.833
I will consult uncle and revert.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.583
Call me after reaching Kakinada.

02:17:53.791 --> 02:17:55.625
Uncle!

02:18:14.791 --> 02:18:16.125
I will do the sacred oblation, sir.

02:18:17.708 --> 02:18:19.166
What about your father?

02:18:19.708 --> 02:18:21.666
My uncle said that both of you
need to perform the oblation.

02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:23.125
Is he joining you?

02:18:24.458 --> 02:18:25.750
I still reiterate the same.

02:18:26.916 --> 02:18:31.458
Is the hard-core atheist
Mr. Lenin Satyam coming to the temple?

02:18:36.416 --> 02:18:37.500
Aradhya.

02:18:38.041 --> 02:18:39.375
We will talk about it only
after the oblation.

02:18:43.833 --> 02:18:47.125
Oh, it's you, son! Come inside.

02:18:47.458 --> 02:18:48.791
Why don't you call him in?

02:18:51.083 --> 02:18:56.375
Does he really want to come inside our
home amid the cows and the rituals we do?

02:18:57.541 --> 02:18:59.250
Carry on. We'll notify you later.

02:19:31.083 --> 02:19:32.166
Do you want to do the oblation?

02:19:33.833 --> 02:19:37.500
This is Chadarangam's scheme
to make me appear like a clown in public.

02:19:38.708 --> 02:19:41.125
You can go for it, but
don't drag me into it.

02:19:42.041 --> 02:19:45.791
I am warning you again. You can't stand
their nonsense for even ten minutes.

02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:49.083
I am done with this discussion.
Forget Aradhya.

02:19:56.458 --> 02:19:58.791
Dad, aren't you and mom
now married for 30 years?

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:01.541
Of course.

02:20:02.083 --> 02:20:04.083
Mom never believes in your
philosophies and principles.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.166
She still believes in God.

02:20:10.125 --> 02:20:11.958
How did you stand her
for all these years, Dad?

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.291
Why didn't you desert mom?

02:20:16.916 --> 02:20:18.125
She is my wife…

02:20:20.291 --> 02:20:21.250
and I…

02:20:24.041 --> 02:20:25.291
love her too much.

02:20:28.583 --> 02:20:31.583
If your love for your wife
can stand for 30 years…

02:20:33.791 --> 02:20:36.875
can't I stand my wife for three hours to
sit for the oblation and oblige her?

02:20:39.083 --> 02:20:40.416
The oblation is in Kakinada tomorrow.

02:20:41.291 --> 02:20:42.500
It starts with me,

02:20:43.583 --> 02:20:44.875
but it will get completed
only with your presence.

02:20:46.083 --> 02:20:46.916
I am leaving.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.208
Wear this dhoti and circumambulate
101 times around the temple.

02:21:14.291 --> 02:21:15.458
Then you must sit for the oblation,

02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:17.375
along with your dad!

02:21:18.208 --> 02:21:20.666
If this Satyam fellow won't turn up,
the whole ceremony will be a waste!

02:21:21.041 --> 02:21:23.416
Are we ready for the oblation, priest?

02:21:29.291 --> 02:21:31.333
Dear, can you help me tie up?

02:21:31.458 --> 02:21:34.083
You're such a grown-up!
Don't you know to wear a dhoti?

02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:38.333
Turn around.

02:22:01.208 --> 02:22:02.958
Hey, the boy is here.
Talk to him.

02:22:03.583 --> 02:22:04.583
Talk to him.

02:22:16.541 --> 02:22:17.375
Aradhya…

02:22:19.166 --> 02:22:21.083
I need to speak to you once.

02:22:23.666 --> 02:22:24.541
Aradhya.

02:22:25.541 --> 02:22:26.416
Hey, Viplav.

02:22:30.458 --> 02:22:31.583
Did she speak to you?

02:22:32.541 --> 02:22:33.541
What's this attire, dude?

02:22:33.666 --> 02:22:35.958
Can't you make out if the
damn thing is coming off?

02:22:36.041 --> 02:22:37.833
Hey, need a holy cow. Go, get it.

02:22:37.958 --> 02:22:38.791
What cow?

02:22:38.916 --> 02:22:41.041
-Cow, dude!
-We need to gift one cow after the ritual.

02:22:41.208 --> 02:22:42.041
Get one, son.

02:22:42.166 --> 02:22:43.125
A cow?

02:22:44.583 --> 02:22:45.541
Mom, where's dad?

02:22:47.708 --> 02:22:49.916
You wished for too much
to expect dad to turn up.

02:22:51.125 --> 02:22:54.875
For him, it is principles
before anything else.

02:22:56.083 --> 02:23:00.166
Let me sit on his behalf.
I will convince the big man.

02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:01.291
Mom, he won't allow.

02:23:02.375 --> 02:23:04.000
It is complete only if dad comes.

02:23:04.333 --> 02:23:05.166
But he won't.

02:23:08.416 --> 02:23:13.166
He sees God and these
temples as mere stones.

02:23:13.958 --> 02:23:16.416
But nobody is as heartless as your dad!

02:23:18.583 --> 02:23:20.000
How did you think

02:23:20.291 --> 02:23:23.583
he will mend ways

02:23:24.333 --> 02:23:26.916
and come for the oblation
only for his son?

02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:51.500
But I will do anything for you, my son.

02:23:52.333 --> 02:23:56.083
Even if it means, falling at their feet.

02:24:14.041 --> 02:24:14.958
Tell me…

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.083
what do I need to do, son?

02:24:18.708 --> 02:24:20.625
You don't worry…

02:24:22.125 --> 02:24:24.708
Uncle, Lenin Satyam has arrived.

02:24:41.208 --> 02:24:42.958
Put saffron on the forehead.

02:25:17.250 --> 02:25:20.083
Sir, hold your nose with
your hands and say "mama".

02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:21.583
"Mama."

02:25:21.916 --> 02:25:22.750
"Mama."

02:25:31.541 --> 02:25:33.791
Pray to God to grant your wish.

02:25:50.166 --> 02:25:51.208
Make a wish.

02:25:59.083 --> 02:26:00.750
Dear, can I bring water for you?

02:26:00.833 --> 02:26:01.791
Dad, are you okay?

02:26:03.291 --> 02:26:04.250
It's okay.

02:26:16.916 --> 02:26:18.625
If you place that in the sacred fire

02:26:18.708 --> 02:26:20.291
then the ritual will be done.
Get up.

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:52.750
Uncle, come.

02:26:52.833 --> 02:26:54.083
Dear, come.

02:26:56.208 --> 02:26:57.333
Dear, come.

02:26:57.666 --> 02:26:59.541
Viplav, come here.

02:27:06.125 --> 02:27:06.958
Ask him to come in.

02:27:08.416 --> 02:27:09.250
Please come.

02:27:10.583 --> 02:27:12.625
Oh God! Why did it have to rain?

02:27:31.291 --> 02:27:32.208
It's okay.

02:27:33.875 --> 02:27:36.875
I'll participate in the ritual
however long it takes.

02:27:39.041 --> 02:27:41.958
I am fine if you win,

02:27:43.583 --> 02:27:44.541
and I lose it.

02:27:48.041 --> 02:27:49.041
It's not a big deal.

02:27:50.541 --> 02:27:52.083
But my son is going to prosper.

02:27:53.916 --> 02:27:54.833
That's enough for me.

02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:01.666
Mr. Satyam…

02:28:03.375 --> 02:28:06.958
when Viplav relented and
came home to commit to this ritual,

02:28:08.083 --> 02:28:09.666
I didn't think we won.

02:28:11.791 --> 02:28:14.083
We saw the depth of love
your son had for my daughter.

02:28:17.333 --> 02:28:20.666
Even today, when you stooped down to
perform this oblation for your son's sake,

02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:22.333
I didn't see my victory.

02:28:24.541 --> 02:28:26.708
I only saw your love for your son.

02:28:29.583 --> 02:28:32.833
While fighting for my
shastras or your philosophy,

02:28:34.291 --> 02:28:36.041
we are forgetting humanity.

02:28:40.708 --> 02:28:42.125
I know that even if I seem like a winner

02:28:42.208 --> 02:28:44.833
by making you bend your
way to sit through the ritual,

02:28:45.833 --> 02:28:48.083
I have lost it as a human being.
What's the point?

02:28:55.583 --> 02:28:57.833
Before I called it off,
God intervened and called it off.

02:28:59.333 --> 02:29:01.541
He will take care of both the kids now.

02:29:06.083 --> 02:29:08.250
You can leave with my
daughter after the rain stops.

02:29:25.458 --> 02:29:27.625
Aradhya… I will do any
number of rigorous rituals…

02:29:29.458 --> 02:29:30.875
or change my attires…

02:29:33.458 --> 02:29:34.708
if you remain with me.

02:29:40.208 --> 02:29:43.333
If this oblation can settle our love,
I would have agreed to it long back.

02:29:45.625 --> 02:29:48.625
I wanted both of us to overcome all of
these and become stronger and hence…

02:29:51.791 --> 02:29:53.416
What does strong mean, Viplav?

02:29:56.958 --> 02:30:00.166
Is it only to threaten…

02:30:02.833 --> 02:30:04.083
or to split ways each time?

02:30:08.541 --> 02:30:11.125
I will ensure we will never
fight again, Aradhya.

02:30:12.791 --> 02:30:13.916
Fights will happen, Viplav.

02:30:14.833 --> 02:30:15.958
Fights will happen.

02:30:18.208 --> 02:30:21.708
But if we are united,
we can say we are stronger.

02:30:23.708 --> 02:30:26.666
While you reckon these
episodes as friction,

02:30:27.958 --> 02:30:28.916
I see it as love.

02:30:31.916 --> 02:30:33.166
We are girls, Viplav.

02:30:35.666 --> 02:30:36.916
There are things we confess to God…

02:30:38.125 --> 02:30:40.375
that we won't dare sharing
even with dad or husband.

02:30:42.375 --> 02:30:43.708
And I left that…

02:30:45.625 --> 02:30:47.750
God to be with you.

02:30:52.041 --> 02:30:54.541
Where shall I go if you ask me to leave?

02:30:57.125 --> 02:30:58.375
I am still learning, Aradhya.

02:30:59.791 --> 02:31:00.916
I am still learning.

02:31:02.916 --> 02:31:04.125
I can see the pain you went through.

02:31:06.791 --> 02:31:10.791
And the affection towards me
behind your desire to do the ritual.

02:31:14.708 --> 02:31:18.000
But when I was alone for ten days…

02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:22.291
I understood how it was like
living without you.

02:31:26.416 --> 02:31:28.041
The way Thomas
stood like a rock for Zoya,

02:31:28.583 --> 02:31:29.541
that's true love.

02:31:31.333 --> 02:31:32.625
I promise to stand by you too.

02:31:33.916 --> 02:31:36.916
Each and every day,
for the rest of our lives!

02:31:39.166 --> 02:31:41.458
Let's complete this oblation
and get back home, Aradhya.

02:31:42.333 --> 02:31:44.333
I don't want any more
of these rituals, Viplav.

02:31:45.625 --> 02:31:47.125
All I need is to be with you.

02:31:48.416 --> 02:31:50.250
Whether we beget kids or not,

02:31:51.375 --> 02:31:54.541
or whether we spend our
last days in old age home,

02:31:54.875 --> 02:31:56.250
we both must be together.

02:31:58.666 --> 02:31:59.541
Kids?

02:32:01.333 --> 02:32:02.666
We don't give them a chance.

02:32:03.958 --> 02:32:05.791
Let's send them to the hostel.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:15.166
Let us demonstrate to the world
that we are meant for each other.

02:32:16.625 --> 02:32:17.708
Let's prove it.

02:32:20.583 --> 02:32:21.500
Let's prove it.

02:32:23.416 --> 02:32:24.333
Let's prove it.

02:32:25.166 --> 02:32:26.166
Let's prove it.

02:32:39.041 --> 02:32:40.000
Uncles…

02:32:40.125 --> 02:32:43.250
as I told you, Aradhya and Viplav are
happily married, and have a baby girl now.

02:32:43.333 --> 02:32:44.625
Both of you
have become grandparents.

02:32:45.208 --> 02:32:46.916
Hello, What's the matter?

02:32:47.291 --> 02:32:51.458
You called me and now
you are making me wait.

02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:54.000
What do you think of me?

02:32:55.666 --> 02:32:58.125
Do you want to get your
child's ear pierced

02:32:58.208 --> 02:32:59.791
under my presence or not?

02:32:59.916 --> 02:33:02.791
-Where is the baby?
-She's coming, sir.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.041
Aradhya, get the baby.

02:33:17.416 --> 02:33:20.666
Wait! Are you going to
pierce her ear with that now?

02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:23.416
Why does he dread me as if I am a
factionist wielding sharp weapon?

02:33:23.541 --> 02:33:26.166
I make this ritual look
like a breeze! Tell him that.

02:33:26.250 --> 02:33:28.333
It will prick like an ant bite, Viplav.

02:33:28.625 --> 02:33:29.833
-Just give her to mother-in-law.
-Give her to me.

02:33:33.083 --> 02:33:34.166
-Careful!
-Careful!

02:33:37.916 --> 02:33:39.041
It's okay, Kanna.

02:33:39.708 --> 02:33:40.541
That's all right.

02:33:41.666 --> 02:33:43.666
-Careful!
-Careful!

02:33:45.833 --> 02:33:48.458
I understand how much
you care for your baby.

02:33:48.916 --> 02:33:51.791
Do we stop taking vaccine
just because it pains a moment?

02:33:51.916 --> 02:33:54.166
Okay, I have an idea.

02:33:59.208 --> 02:34:01.875
-Careful!
-To heck with all of you!

02:34:01.958 --> 02:34:06.208
Sir, just be a bit careful. Please.

02:34:06.708 --> 02:34:07.791
What?

02:34:08.375 --> 02:34:10.750
Just be careful. Please.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.416
Oh!

02:34:13.083 --> 02:34:14.250
Please be careful.

02:34:15.208 --> 02:34:17.166
We are just asking you to be careful.

02:34:17.583 --> 02:34:19.000
Why don't you come and do this yourself?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:21.583
Everyone is instructing me.

02:34:22.583 --> 02:34:25.000
Not now. We'll do it
after the girl grows up.

02:34:25.083 --> 02:34:28.541
Will you get her ear pierced
after she grows up?

02:34:29.583 --> 02:34:33.166
Better do it after she reaches her age.

02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:35.041
You can call me then.
I will do the needful.

02:34:35.125 --> 02:34:37.250
Oh, no. Guruji, please don't mind.

02:34:37.333 --> 02:34:38.250
Sit down.

02:34:38.583 --> 02:34:41.166
-Son, will you agree or not?
-No, Mom.

02:34:41.333 --> 02:34:43.583
-Why?
-Just look into my eyes.

02:34:43.958 --> 02:34:46.625
Look into my eyes.
It's fine. Close your eyes.

02:34:46.708 --> 02:34:48.208
-Close your eyes.
-Please carry on, guruji.

02:34:51.625 --> 02:34:53.375
Don't move.

02:34:53.458 --> 02:34:54.750
Hold her.

02:34:56.875 --> 02:34:58.458
It's over.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.375
Look at how cute she is.

02:35:00.833 --> 02:35:02.833
Now look at her.
Look how cute she is.

02:35:02.916 --> 02:35:03.958
So much drama around this piercing.

02:35:04.083 --> 02:35:05.750
All of you wanted me to be careful.

02:35:05.875 --> 02:35:07.666
And you were saying
that we can do it later.

02:35:07.833 --> 02:35:09.041
What did you name her?
