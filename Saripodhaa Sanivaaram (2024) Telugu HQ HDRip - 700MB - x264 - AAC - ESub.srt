1
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:44,458
SOKULAPALEM

2
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,541
Everyone's story starts with a mother.

3
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,291
So does mine.

4
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,250
Chinnu…

5
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,916
Do you know what true anger means?

6
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,458
PROLOGUE

7
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,458
Hey, why are you being a baby?

8
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,791
You heard the doctor.

9
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,291
No matter what we do,

10
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,666
I won't make it past two months.

11
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,166
It is what it is.

12
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,541
You've done beyond your potential.

13
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,166
What more can you do?

14
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,250
This is just my fate.

15
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,666
Can I get through life without you?

16
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,666
When I think of our kids…

17
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,500
I get worried about their future.

18
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,125
Don't tell them yet.

19
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:20,916
First, let me tell them
how to take on life.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,000
We can tell them slowly later.

21
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,083
Your son needs…

22
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,750
most of the talking.

23
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,791
He beat someone up again.

24
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,333
If he repeats this…

25
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,416
they'll rusticate him from school.

26
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,750
I wonder where all his anger comes from.

27
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,166
Where else?

28
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,000
If you're Chayadevi,
your son is Suryakantham.

29
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,791
He's gone after his feisty mother.

30
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,666
Hey!

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,375
Hey, brother-in-law!
Send Chaya out!

32
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,458
Seethapathi.

33
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,750
My uncle.

34
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,125
They're our only relatives.

35
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,250
My aunt, Prabhavathi.

36
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,333
And her daughter Kalyani.

37
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,375
Kallu for short.

38
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,125
My Kallu.

39
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,583
She doesn't like me one bit.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,875
Reason being…

41
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,083
my anger.

42
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,541
Surya!

43
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,125
He used to come home drunk
and beat up my aunt every day.

44
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,875
So my mom made his wife file a
complaint against her own brother.

45
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,291
She sent him to jail.

46
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,291
I'll not spare you!

47
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
But she knew that wasn't the solution.

48
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,500
So, without anyone's knowledge…

49
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,000
she wanted to send them to another city.

50
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,583
Kallu didn't say a word
to me before leaving.

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,541
She didn't even give me a chance
to tell her how much I love her.

52
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,666
-Come on out!
-You're creating a havoc every day!

53
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,083
-You're enjoying with your spouse at home.
-What is it?

54
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,416
I'm roaming on the streets like an orphan.

55
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,958
You…
Answer me!

56
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,916
Hey, mind your language!

57
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,625
You went to jail and
you're still as barbaric.

58
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,750
-Yes, I am!
-Hey!

59
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,541
What's with this drama every day?
We're not able to sleep.

60
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,541
She sent my wife and daughter away.

61
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,333
Tell her to give me their address.

62
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,916
Tell him where they are.
He'll take them home.

63
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,541
-I don't know.
-Come on! He's your brother.

64
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,625
He's not my brother.

65
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,166
I don't have a brother.

66
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,625
I have nothing to do with this man.

67
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,291
I don't care if you hit him
or report him to the police.

68
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,250
Come inside.

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,750
-Do whatever the hell you want.
-You don't know me?

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,875
-Get out of here!
-Let me go!

71
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,000
-Tell me where my wife and daughter are!
-Hey!

72
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,708
Why do you want extra
trouble in this situation?

73
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,083
Just tell him where they are.

74
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,958
They're living safely and
independently. Let them.

75
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,708
You saw what he does to them.

76
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,250
I'll break his legs! Take him away!

77
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,583
No, listen to me.

78
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,833
No matter what anyone says,
I won't reveal their whereabouts.

79
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:09,916
Not even to you.

80
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,083
Where did he go?

81
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,833
Come.

82
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,583
Come.

83
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,375
Tired, already?

84
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,791
Come.

85
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,541
You can't just hit people
when you're angry.

86
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,166
Is there no other way?

87
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,666
That's the only way I know.

88
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,125
Chinnu, look at me.

89
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,583
If you lose your temper for everything,

90
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,500
your anger will have no meaning.

91
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,833
Your anger needs to have a purpose.

92
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,666
A reason.

93
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,291
Am I right?

94
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,750
There is a reason, Mom.

95
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,958
Uncle called you--

96
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,375
Will you listen to your mom?

97
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,916
Come.

98
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,416
Let's dedicate a day to your anger.

99
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,833
What do you mean?

100
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,625
Well, you can't express
your anger every day.

101
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,083
A dedicated day for your anger.

102
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,250
One day a week.

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,041
No matter how furious you are,

104
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,125
you can express it only on that one day.

105
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,125
Even if it gets tough on the other days,

106
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,708
you should control your anger somehow.

107
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,125
Why so?

108
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,916
Because more than half the instances
that make you angry are pointless.

109
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,166
So whenever you feel angry,

110
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,708
pause for a while, think about it,

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,833
and if you still feel the
same anger towards them,

112
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,625
you can express it on that one day.

113
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,083
Okay?

114
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:28,875
Promise me.

115
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,166
I can express it on that one day, right?

116
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,666
My sweetheart!

117
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,125
Tell me which day that is.

118
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,916
From now on,

119
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,458
whenever you feel angry,

120
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,666
you come to me and tell me.

121
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,583
The day your anger is truly justified,

122
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,500
I won't say a word.

123
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,583
That day, you do what you want.

124
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,625
Okay?

125
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,083
With the patience
And affection of an angel

126
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,708
Just because you learned to cook,

127
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,500
doesn't mean you live in the kitchen.

128
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,125
This is just another subject like
the ones you have in school.

129
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,958
Understood?

130
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,125
Let me taste it.

131
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,041
It's yummy.

132
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,291
Mom, today?

133
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,500
What happened?

134
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,708
Rakesh spilled ink on my shirt.

135
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,458
Tell me, is today the day?

136
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,583
WEDNESDAY

137
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,708
Wednesday is always a…

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,500
A journey of hope that goes on forever

139
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,458
Mom, today?

140
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,458
MONDAY

141
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,166
If you strike off every day,

142
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,083
how do I control my anger, Mom?

143
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,958
You've been reading the
same lesson for four days.

144
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,791
What lesson is it?

145
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,708
Deepavali.

146
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,375
I have an idea.

147
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,500
"There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

148
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,833
He used to trouble people a lot.

149
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,791
So, Sri Krishna teamed up
with Satyabhama and killed him."

150
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:10,750
It's the beginning of a new spring

151
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:17,375
Silence brings this sweet agony

152
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,041
There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

153
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,333
He used to trouble people a lot.

154
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,166
So Sri Krishna teamed up
with Satyabhama and killed him!

155
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,625
What's with these stupid
scribbles on the wall?

156
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,833
Whack him a couple of times
and all his anger will come down.

157
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,583
You can't expect change
without a seed of hope.

158
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,791
You're only thinking about the one
day he's going to express his anger.

159
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,750
I'm thinking about the six days
when he won't cross the line.

160
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,666
I'm worried about him
exploding on that one day,

161
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,458
after holding it in for so long.

162
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,291
I don't get this
"angry one day a week" thing.

163
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,583
Chinnu…

164
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,583
Chinnu…

165
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,333
Do you know what true anger means?

166
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,666
Chinnu?

167
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,750
I didn't listen to what
she said that night.

168
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,541
And I didn't know that I
would never hear it again.

169
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:41,916
Mom…

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,083
Mom, get up!

171
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,583
She's dead!

172
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,083
-Hey!
-Go away!

173
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,750
Go away! Don't create a scene!

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,250
Get out of here!

175
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,958
Enough of your nuisance!

176
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,333
I don't care really.

177
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,458
But where did you send
my wife and little girl?

178
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,583
You witch!

179
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,208
Bloody witch, get up!

180
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,041
Get up!

181
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,541
Have you lost your mind?

182
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,666
She's your sister, damn it!
When will you change?

183
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,000
Mom, today?

184
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,750
Mom, today?

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,875
FRIDAY

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,958
SATURDAY

187
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:18,958
Mom…

188
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,791
Transition…

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,666
Origin…

190
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,000
Arrival…

191
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,250
The day your anger is truly justified,

192
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,750
I won't say a word.

193
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,458
You do whatever you want.

194
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,041
SATURDAY

195
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,125
Okay?

196
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,833
He, the one who breaks
The shackles of doubt

197
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,625
With a fierce and intense gaze

198
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,583
His nails are like blazing
Flames on a mountain

199
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,708
He is the constant force
Of balance on a Saturday

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,916
Of balance…

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,125
Usually, we feel happy
when kids listen to their parents.

202
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,291
But my son has taken his
mom's word so seriously.

203
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,875
Sometimes, I don't know
whether to laugh or cry about it.

204
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,083
Is he still doing the Saturday thing?

205
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,333
He's not just following it.

206
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,208
Like a lizard that grows into a chameleon,

207
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,416
he's obsessed with the concept.

208
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,916
From Sunday to Friday,

209
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,916
he comes home without picking
a fight no matter how pissed he is.

210
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,583
But before going to bed,

211
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,333
he writes in his diary
as if it's holy scripture.

212
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,708
"Who?"
"What they have done?"

213
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,541
He follows this religiously till Friday.

214
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,250
-What about Saturday?
-Saturday!

215
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,500
He wakes up in the morning.

216
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,833
He introspects if he's still
angry at the people in his diary.

217
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,375
If his anger has passed, it's all good.

218
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,125
He strikes off their names.

219
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,833
And if he's still angry?

220
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,791
He circles their names.

221
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,041
NARAYANA PRABHA

222
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,000
And once he circles a name…

223
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,333
he goes to any length to beat them up.

224
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,625
He gets there one way or the other.

225
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,916
Hello, bro. My boss is going out of town.

226
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,458
He won't be back for another week.

227
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,916
Hello? Are you there, bro?

228
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,125
Hello?

229
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,375
You must've heard about
Yama and Chitragupta.

230
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,375
Imagine if he's both,
a split personality.

231
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,500
Where is he headed, looking like that?

232
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,750
It's normal to get angry
when our family is bothered.

233
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,458
But my son makes people his family,

234
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,958
based on his anger.

235
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,208
What do you mean?

236
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,375
Fazil, did he hit you again?

237
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,541
Yeah, bro.

238
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,958
-How many stitches did you get?
-Six.

239
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,208
Fazil, didn't I warn you about that man?

240
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,166
That stupid habit
of yours has led to this.

241
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,708
-But you couldn't care less.
-Cut him some slack.

242
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,875
That man roughed him up so
badly and you're taking his side.

243
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,041
Just be careful, man.

244
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,791
Everyone shows sympathy.

245
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,916
But nobody comes
forward to confront my boss.

246
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,541
Who's your boss?

247
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,708
Who are you, bro?

248
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,791
I'll tell you.

249
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,375
But first, who's your boss?

250
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,208
Aren't you coming back, Kali uncle?

251
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,625
Not if you keep crying like this.

252
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,958
Stop crying and study well.

253
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,583
I'll visit you soon.

254
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,875
-Don't get intimidated by Grandpa.
-Okay.

255
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,833
Call me if you need anything at all.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,541
You can also
call me if you need anything.

257
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,166
What's up, Fazil?

258
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,250
Hello, sir. I'm Surya.

259
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,208
Are you expecting me to introduce myself?

260
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,750
Not at all. Who doesn't
know Narayana Prabha?

261
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,625
He told me you hit him because
he set the clock ten minutes ahead.

262
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,541
He could've lost his eye.

263
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,083
What do you propose we do?

264
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,333
Simple, sir.

265
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,666
Every action has a reason.

266
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,500
I think it was unfair to hit him
without knowing the reason.

267
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,458
If you listen to his reason…

268
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,500
you'll see why he did it.

269
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,708
-Bro…
-Tell him.

270
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,375
Speak out.

271
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,500
Well, sir…

272
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,958
My dad fell under
a running train and died.

273
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,333
Ever since then,
my mom would always say…

274
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,458
"I wish your father was ten
minutes early to the station.

275
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,625
Our lives would've been different."

276
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,583
That is why every time I see a clock,

277
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,333
I feel like setting it ten minutes ahead.

278
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,000
-I don't want anyone else to lose--
-You heard him.

279
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,958
Let's not get into whether
his habit is right or wrong.

280
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,791
But if his habit comes
from a good intention,

281
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:22,916
we should support him.

282
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,791
What do you have to say?

283
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,541
I have nothing to say.

284
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,458
-How is he related to you though?
-We're not related, sir.

285
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,291
No relation whatsoever.

286
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,541
But after listening to his story…

287
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,500
I got angry.

288
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,708
And once I get angry…

289
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,791
he becomes my family.

290
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,250
His problem becomes mine.

291
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,250
He won't work for you if
you're going to hit him again.

292
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,250
Promise me you won't.

293
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,083
I'll apologize to the kid first…

294
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,458
and then deal with your anger.

295
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,916
No apologies needed, sir.

296
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,416
-Sir!
-You expect me to apologize,

297
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,666
you little scum!

298
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,041
Was that a warning?

299
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,833
"There was a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

300
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,041
He used to trouble people a lot.

301
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:20,208
I arrived ten minutes early to a
meeting and everyone called me jobless.

302
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,083
You didn't just do a shitty job…

303
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,500
but you gave me
an even shittier reason.

304
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,291
Don't even get me started on this bugger.

305
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,000
What are you chanting in Hindi?

306
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,000
What are you going to do?

307
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,166
Hey!

308
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,708
If you don't quit that habit of yours…

309
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,708
I'll whack you again.

310
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,625
And this time, I'll make
sure you lose your eye.

311
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,541
You'll lose an eye as well,
for taking his side.

312
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,875
You understand?

313
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,583
Get lost!

314
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,375
Hey, get him stitched up again
and send him back to work.

315
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,041
Who the hell are you, bro?

316
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,250
You dragged me all the way for this?

317
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,708
Just like you…

318
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,541
I have a habit as well.

319
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,791
I didn't know he could fight, man.

320
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,250
In your eyes, in front of you
He'll show fear!

321
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:43,833
Not one, not two
In the list of eight, he's burst out!

322
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:48,916
All in all, the one playing
Is like a butterfly!

323
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,375
Even if he's caught, he won't show
He keeps it in his mound!

324
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:58,375
Guys, the angry bird came
with a half-shaved face.

325
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,833
Shave the rest and send him home.

326
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:06,125
On the enemy's head slate
He writes fate!

327
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,916
Fist by fist, it's Yama
If you smile, it's Shiva

328
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,250
Heart by heart, it's iron
Body of an elephant

329
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:27,500
Whoever the enemy
If he comes, he bleeds

330
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:33,041
Face of fire and water
He's a different breed

331
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,208
Fazil won't work for you anymore.

332
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,166
Thanks, bro.

333
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,208
Goodbye, sir.

334
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,750
Goodbye.

335
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,708
Get this stitched up.

336
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,458
Hey, I don't understand.

337
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,666
Why didn't you hit me that day?

338
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,666
And why did you hit me today?

339
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,208
What? Did I hit a nerve?

340
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,875
Everyone has seven days in a week.

341
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,625
But I have only one.

342
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,666
Only one day.

343
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,458
Saturday.

344
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,458
Why?

345
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,291
Isn't that enough?

346
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:04,416
As Brahma, as Narasimha
He'll create a new world, watch!

347
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:10,000
As Buddha, as a great warrior
Will transform into a fierce tiger

348
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:15,208
To touch or to leave
He'll say instantly, that person

349
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:21,333
On Saturday he'll fight the enemy
On other days, like a sage!

350
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,041
So, your son is rowdy?

351
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,833
Hey, not at all.

352
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,166
Then?

353
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,000
Mention that his leg
was broken as well, sir.

354
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,625
It will help them when they're on a break.

355
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,708
-Why don't you do it?
-No, sir. It's your job.

356
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,000
You always have some shit to say.

357
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,250
To wish for your family's wellness
for as long as you live is selfishness.

358
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,166
But to wish for your family's
wellness even while you're gone is…

359
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,500
responsibility.

360
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,875
This is our life insurance.

361
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,250
That is Surya!

362
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,375
Since our 25th anniversary is coming up…

363
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:30,500
I'm giving Surya the responsibility
of picking the Chief Guest.

364
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,791
Claps, guys.

365
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,000
When a guy with such a
peculiar lifestyle lives in the house…

366
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,500
imagine how peculiar
our lifestyle must be.

367
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,291
Hey!

368
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,500
There was a demon--

369
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,250
-I'm Santhosh.
-He's here, brother.

370
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,083
Bhadra, we have to go.

371
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,416
What's wrong, Surya?

372
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,458
-Let's go.
-Surya!

373
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,291
-Surya!
-Just get on the damn bike.

374
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,666
Leave the car behind.

375
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,166
Come fast. Run.

376
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,125
Hey, get back here!

377
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,583
Hey!

378
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,333
There lived a demon called
Narsapur in the olden days.

379
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,583
It's not Narsapur.

380
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,375
It's Narakasur.

381
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,458
There lived a demon!

382
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,500
Why did he spare him?

383
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,791
The clock struck 12.

384
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,000
-So he won't hit him till next Saturday?
-No.

385
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,916
He'll never hit him again.

386
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,916
There's another stupid
rule in his rulebook.

387
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:01,166
If he can't hit a certain
person by that Saturday,

388
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,583
he believes his mom
doesn't want him to hit them.

389
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,833
So he spares them
forever in his mom's name.

390
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,000
He even made friends out of this.

391
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,083
Hey!

392
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,750
Thank you for sparing my grandpa.

393
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,125
Happy New Year.

394
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,583
Happy New Year.

395
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,666
I thought at least marriage would fix him.

396
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,208
Hey, there was this girl, right?
What's her name?

397
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Kallu. Did you guys find her?

398
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,125
We moved multiple times due to this guy.
So we completely lost touch.

399
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,041
Bu,t he…

400
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,875
-Your name?
-Kalyani.

401
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,541
Is your mom's name Prabhavathi?

402
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,333
Which Prabhavathi?

403
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,000
Who the hell are you,
calling at this hour?

404
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,375
Nothing. No. No. We're calling
from the Election Commission.

405
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,708
We don't know where they live now.

406
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,375
Even if we do, she hates you.

407
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,500
She wouldn't even step inside
the house when you were around.

408
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:57,708
That was back then.

409
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,541
I'm a changed man. She'll
also change when she finds out.

410
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,666
This is not the film Mayabazar where
everyone changes instantaneously.

411
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,500
Moreover, it's not enough if
you declare that you've changed.

412
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,708
What if she's married by now?

413
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:08,791
-Exactly!
-Hey!

414
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:09,875
Why do you manifest negative things?

415
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,916
Y'all may not know how much I love her.

416
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,083
But my aunt knows.

417
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,291
She would never let her get married.

418
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,708
I expected this.

419
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:27,041
He has a fixated mindset.

420
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Once he sets his mind
to something, that's it.

421
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,416
That is why we did what we had to.

422
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,083
They say remove a thorn with a thorn.

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,916
But what about Kallu?

424
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,916
It's been four years
since Mom left us, Surya.

425
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,291
She remembered you even in her last days.

426
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,750
That's true.

427
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,083
Apparently, they searched for us

428
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,125
to invite us to her wedding.

429
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,916
But we moved so much, you know.

430
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,208
We're living in Mumbai now, Surya.

431
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,625
My husband got a job in the US recently.

432
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,750
We came to Hyderabad
for some visa work.

433
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,541
I was at the bank…

434
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:07,416
when I heard a sweet
voice say "Uncle" from behind.

435
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:11,375
Initially, I was surprised
to see who it was.

436
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,750
I couldn't believe that
Kallu was all grown up now.

437
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,166
This is my husband, Surya.

438
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,333
He's your brother by relation.

439
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,625
He belongs in the 60s or 70s.

440
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,875
He's so old fashioned, I forget
who's the father and who's the son.

441
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:38,958
Surya!

442
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,458
Surya!

443
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,125
Surya, don't cry.

444
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,375
Listen to me.

445
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,083
-What's this?
-It's a ring.

446
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:46,750
When did you buy it?

447
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,375
First salary.

448
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,916
-How much was it?
-Go away!

449
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:55,041
It's okay, Surya.

450
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,583
Oh, my dear.

451
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,541
Why are you crying?

452
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,333
I can see you and your mom are happy.

453
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,541
Oh, no! Poor boy!

454
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,041
He's not so noble that
you feel sympathy for him.

455
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,750
You wouldn't say that if you heard
what he did at his sister's wedding.

456
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,541
There was a disagreement
regarding the bride's saree.

457
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,666
Bhadra wanted to wear her mom's saree.

458
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:18,208
We need to compromise
on a few things in a love marriage.

459
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,166
They wanted her to wear the saree
that was offered to the Goddess.

460
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,958
Don't you think
we have our own sentiments?

461
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,250
My daughter's stubbornness won in the end.

462
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,333
Before things calmed down,

463
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,708
something ugly was said.

464
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,583
-Don't get on my nerves.
-Listen to me, brother.

465
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,125
Should we back down because
of a random floozy who's no more?

466
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,875
-To hell with you guys!
-Somebody might hear you.

467
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,458
I don't care. I'm not afraid.

468
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,375
He shouldn't have said that.

469
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,708
I'm equally pissed.

470
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,916
I'll handle him. I'll go talk to him.

471
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Hey! Stop with the mumbling.

472
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,416
Listen.

473
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,875
If you do anything right now,

474
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,166
she's going to pay for it later on.

475
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,083
Keep that in mind.

476
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,208
We assumed we had convinced him.

477
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,791
But we could only control him
till the wedding was over…

478
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,833
That's what we realized
once the clock struck 12.

479
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,916
Surya, stop!

480
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,291
Listen to me.

481
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,958
-Surya, I said stop!
-How dare you hit me!

482
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,333
Don't you have respect for the elders?

483
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,791
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

484
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm the groom's father,
for heaven's sake.

485
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,500
-Are you out of your mind, Surya?
-Hit him.

486
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,166
Please stop, Surya. I'm begging you.

487
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,166
Surya!

488
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,291
We discussed this before
going ahead with the marriage.

489
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,500
Look at him.

490
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:49,125
Why does Dad have to
beg them for forgiveness?

491
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,375
Can't you see his pain?

492
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,958
How can I live with
that family after this?

493
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,791
Imagine how they'll treat me.

494
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,000
So, you don't really care about us.

495
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,500
You just want to
get your way all the time.

496
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,458
I've had enough.

497
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,208
I'm so fed up of trying
to change your ways.

498
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,875
Do whatever the hell you want!

499
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,750
I won't be a part of your life anymore.

500
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,666
And I expect the same from you.

501
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,500
Sister…

502
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,500
Please don't say that.

503
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,208
Sorry.

504
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,333
-I'll go apologize to them as well.
-No need.

505
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,708
Just let me go.

506
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,458
I said let go!

507
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,958
Surya, you know me.

508
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,583
I'll do something regretful
if you don't let me go.

509
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,458
She's my only daughter.

510
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,333
I couldn't even give her
a proper send-off.

511
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,833
My son-in-law is a good man.

512
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,750
He stood by her.

513
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,875
Because of this foolish man,

514
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,375
she doesn't have a maternal
or a paternal home now.

515
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,375
Imagine how I must be feeling.
I'd be fuming with rage.

516
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,083
That is why I went out of my way
and decided something.

517
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,250
Every Saturday,

518
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:16,333
I made it my duty to find his targets
at any cost and save them.

519
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,416
He doesn't hit them once
that Saturday passes.

520
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,000
In fact, that is why I came to see you.

521
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,333
I'm sorry, I don't get it.

522
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,375
The second name on my son's list
for this Saturday is…

523
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,916
Teertham Gunasekhar.

524
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,458
That's your husband, right?

525
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
He's not in the city.

526
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,083
He said he'd be back in two days
since he had a fever.

527
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,666
You have a temperature of 102 degrees.

528
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,208
Drink this.

529
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:54,458
Go to sleep.

530
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:55,666
Now!

531
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,125
I don't know what your husband has done.

532
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,750
He works at the same
school as my daughter.

533
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,250
Are you okay?

534
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,166
Hey, Bhadra ma'am. Just a minute.

535
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

536
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,541
If you report this and the news gets out,

537
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,125
she will suffer the
consequences more than me.

538
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,625
See you.

539
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,041
Damn…

540
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,875
Time to wake up.

541
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,500
THE TURN

542
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,750
YOUR SAFETY IS OUR PRIORITY

543
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,333
Sir.

544
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,500
Sir.

545
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,250
New joinee.

546
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,250
Charulatha.

547
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,125
-Joining today?
-Yes, sir.

548
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,291
Show this to the CI once he's here.

549
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:52,625
Take this.

550
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,583
-Sir, the CI…
-He will be coming.

551
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,416
Eat your food.

552
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:11,166
Waiting for the CI, right?

553
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,250
I see that you're eager to join duty.

554
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,375
This is how it is at first.

555
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,583
But once you meet him,

556
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:22,083
you'll never ask to see him again.

557
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,333
That's how our CI is.

558
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,958
Dayanand.

559
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,000
-Sudha…
-Sir.

560
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:10,041
The car is stinking despite
trying so many perfumes.

561
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,333
Yes, sir.

562
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,375
-We should find a new perfume.
-Sir.

563
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:16,958
Do you know any?

564
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,125
Good perfumes.

565
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,500
-Did you send his video?
-Sir?

566
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,833
-Did you send his video or not?
-Yes, I did, sir.

567
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,708
I called him as well.
But no response.

568
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,583
I wonder what's keeping him so busy.

569
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,916
What the hell is he up to?

570
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,291
Speak up.

571
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,500
Who the hell sent you?

572
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,791
-I didn't stab him.
-Who sent you?

573
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,416
-I'm telling the truth.
-Spit it out.

574
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,000
I said, speak out!

575
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:45,958
Who the hell sent you, damn it?

576
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:48,791
-I really don't know anything.
-Who sent you, man?

577
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,375
-Do you want to tell us or die?
-Believe me, bro.

578
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,166
-You bloody bugger! Tell us!
-Hey, stop!

579
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,708
Stop it! Cut the drama!

580
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,083
Just stop!

581
00:36:56,875 --> 00:37:00,000
Why did you want to kill me?

582
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,791
-Has the video downloaded?
-Network is slow here, bro.

583
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:03,958
Go outside and do it.

584
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,375
-What are you standing here for? Get out.
-Okay.

585
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,666
Do you know how it feels
to have a threat to your life?

586
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,833
It wasn't me, sir.

587
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,208
You can't sleep, relax,
or, do anything at all, in fact.

588
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,791
You're always looking out
for an attack on you.

589
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:24,291
Your heart keeps pounding
in your ears out of fear.

590
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,083
You can't focus on anything else.
You go crazy.

591
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,125
Just like I am right now.

592
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,083
Tell me.

593
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,333
Why did you stab me at the airport?

594
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,541
-Tell me!
-Sir, I swear I'm innocent.

595
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,041
Some other guy was trying to stab you.

596
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,708
I intervened to stop him.

597
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,291
Do I look like a fool to you?

598
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,458
Am I looking like a fricking fool?

599
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,708
-I really don't know, sir.
-Okay, no problem.

600
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,000
-Are you going to spit it out now?
-Brother!

601
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,041
-I'm really innocent, sir.
-Yeah, right. You're a good boy.

602
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,208
Bro, he's right.

603
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,541
Hey, quiet!

604
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,083
He's not the one who attempted murder.

605
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,583
He just grabbed the knife from him.

606
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,166
In fact, he's the one who saved you.

607
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,833
Couldn't you come a bit early, you moron?

608
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,750
He has lost half a liter of blood already.

609
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,041
And a finger.

610
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:08,916
Bro, bro, bro… I'm sorry.
Please don't mind.

611
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,458
I have a judgment issue due to this eye.

612
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,375
I can't see things clearly.

613
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,583
Hence the lapse in judgment.

614
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:18,458
What are you guys looking at?
Rush him to the hospital.

615
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:19,916
Go, go, go.

616
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,083
Don't worry.

617
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,875
Why is my judgment
so off all the time, man?

618
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,625
Wrong judgment every fricking time!

619
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:37,541
Where's Govardhan?

620
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,083
Please, sir.

621
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:40,916
I have two kids.

622
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,541
Oh, two kids!

623
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,125
A girl and a boy?

624
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,666
Both boys.

625
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,166
Wow, two boys!

626
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,000
You must have been elated.

627
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,541
Who's your favorite?

628
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,000
The elder one or the younger one?

629
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,791
Nothing like that, sir.
I love them equally.

630
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,416
If you give me such soap opera bullshit,

631
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,708
I'll put a bullet in your head.

632
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,625
Be honest.

633
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:10,083
The elder one or the younger one?

634
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,708
I love my younger one a little more, sir.

635
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,791
I knew it.

636
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:21,333
Because you became the father
of two sons after he was born.

637
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,708
Am I right?

638
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,583
I guess so, sir.

639
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,083
Hey, idiot!

640
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,750
You became a father in the first
place because of the elder son.

641
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:33,458
By that logic, he should be your favorite.

642
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,333
You don't get it.

643
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,333
You think nobody knows that you
love your younger son a little more.

644
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:44,583
But your elder son
is watching from a corner.

645
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:47,625
He's furious on the inside.

646
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:48,750
But on who?

647
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:50,208
Me.

648
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,250
No, you idiot.

649
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,333
Why would he be furious at you?

650
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,166
He's furious at your younger son.

651
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,708
If all this anger builds up…
And say, you die tomorrow,

652
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,833
what if the elder one betrays his younger
brother while splitting the assets?

653
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:03,375
What will you do?

654
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,208
With the wealth inherited from you

655
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:07,458
and the wealth looted
from his younger brother,

656
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,083
your elder son will own
three times the money.

657
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,000
He will go on to become
a Corporator and then an MLA.

658
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:18,375
But your younger son
will be working a modest CI job,

659
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,625
with a salary that does him no good,

660
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,833
and a hopeless ambition to grow
as big as his elder brother.

661
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:30,625
In an attempt to save the only
piece of land he owns now,

662
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,833
he kidnaps his brother's
auditor and Benami,

663
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,541
assuming that he's a very important man.

664
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:41,208
Only to find out that
he's a loser like you.

665
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,708
Now the elder son
doesn't answer his calls.

666
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:47,166
See?

667
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,291
Your favoritism led to so many troubles.

668
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,625
Such a waste!

669
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:55,958
-Sudha.
-Sir.

670
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,166
Let him go.

671
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,375
But why, sir?

672
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,250
What else can we do, Sudha?

673
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:05,916
He's a waste piece.

674
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,875
Like tissue paper.

675
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,041
If he were so important…

676
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,708
my brother would've
called immediately and said,

677
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,416
"If you hurt Govardhan,
I'll not spare you.

678
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,458
You want my signature
on the land papers, right?

679
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,541
You can have it. Send the papers over."

680
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,291
That's what would've happened.

681
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:25,958
Tissue paper.

682
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:27,416
Let him go.

683
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,000
Hello! Hey, hey!

684
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,416
Let Govardhan go!

685
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,333
I'll not spare you if you hurt him.

686
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,333
You want my signature, right?
Send the papers over.

687
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,125
But if you don't let him go
as soon as I sign the papers…

688
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:06,833
Hey! Hey!

689
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,708
Sudha! Sudha!

690
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,916
-Catch him! He's highly important!
-What's wrong, sir?

691
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,875
-Govardhan!
-He left, sir.

692
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,916
He's not a waste piece, Sudha.

693
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,750
I'm the loser here.

694
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:23,833
What happened, sir?

695
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,208
-My brother called.
-Sir?!

696
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,041
I have to do something.

697
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,291
I let the opportunity slip.

698
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,625
I have to do something.

699
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:34,291
I just let 45 crores go.

700
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,500
-I have to do something.
-Should I start the car?

701
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,041
SOKULAPALEM

702
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,708
I don't think he's coming today.

703
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,666
Listen to me, go home.

704
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:01,666
Hey!

705
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,083
-Hey!
-Sir…

706
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,083
I guess you just got lucky.

707
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,708
There he is.

708
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:10,208
Sir, I'm begging you!
Please let me go!

709
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,208
Hey!

710
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,541
Sir, I'm begging you!
Please let me go!

711
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,375
What did he do to deserve
such a brash beating, sir?

712
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:22,541
Have you heard of the famous Stuartpuram?

713
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:26,583
Similarly, here we have Sokulapalem.

714
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:29,125
Being born there is their biggest mistake.

715
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,583
Some people vent their anger
on their wives and kids.

716
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,458
Some people vent it on things.

717
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,083
Poor guy!

718
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,833
He doesn't have a wife or kids.

719
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,916
And the only things in hand are…

720
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,791
the people of Sokulapalem.

721
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,041
Hey!

722
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,375
Chinnu…

723
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,833
Do you know what true anger means?

724
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:09,750
Chinnu…

725
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,208
Dad… Dad…

726
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,583
What is it?

727
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,541
Is it the true anger dream again?

728
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,208
What do you think Mom tried to tell me?

729
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,333
To heck with you, man!

730
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,208
You're giving me hell.

731
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,250
Hand me that book.

732
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:37,916
I noted this down from a sermon
by Nithyananda.

733
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,208
He says…

734
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:40,583
"Truth is anger.

735
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,208
And the anger is truth.

736
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,750
But the actual anger
resides in actual truth…

737
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,958
which in turn will become anger,
which is full of truth."

738
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:52,500
-It's definitely not that.
-What is it then?

739
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,958
You dozed off without listening to your
Mom completely when you were young.

740
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,958
Now you're not letting me sleep in peace.

741
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,125
I can't do this anymore.

742
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,916
Only a miracle worker can
save you from this tragedy.

743
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,958
What's the delay, man?

744
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,375
He said he's here, sir.
I don't know where he went.

745
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,541
I'll go check.

746
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,166
Sir, we'll be right back.

747
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,333
Sir…

748
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,250
Sir…

749
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,166
-Sir!
-You dare ask me!

750
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,125
-Sir…
-What happened, sir?

751
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,041
How dare he ask me for
directions to the toilet, Sudha?

752
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,666
Do I look jobless enough to give
you directions to the toilet?

753
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,875
I thought you were
a friendly police officer, sir.

754
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:45,083
-Find the toilets by yourself.
-Okay, sir.

755
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:48,666
Can't you do the bare minimum
to clear your bladder?

756
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,500
-What happened, Sudha?
-Sir, he spoke to your brother.

757
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,250
Despite telling him that you let
Govardhan go before his call came,

758
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,500
he's creating a fuss
about the whole thing.

759
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,166
Clients are waiting upstairs.

760
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,291
They agreed to wait only for a month.

761
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,458
Why is your daughter going
to Bangalore all of a sudden?

762
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,166
Bangalore? She hasn't told me about it.

763
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:17,791
You're getting a call.

764
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,875
Hello, dear.

765
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:25,000
Dad, I'm going to Bangalore for a meeting.

766
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,000
That's sudden.

767
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,958
Yeah, I know.
They informed me last minute.

768
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,250
I have to leave early in the morning.

769
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,708
I have a lot of packing to do. Bye, Dad.

770
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,750
Alright.

771
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,000
Take care.

772
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,583
How's my network?

773
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,375
It's like washing your face
after bawling your eyes out.

774
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:44,666
Stop giving money to the peon
until she comes back at least.

775
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,500
By the way,

776
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:50,250
Mr. Chakravarthy wants you to know
that his daughter lives here.

777
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,833
Isn't it kind of unsafe
to reveal her whereabouts?

778
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,541
Enough of your lame jokes.

779
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,750
What should I tell them?

780
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,500
Hey!

781
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,208
Is this it, Dad?

782
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,416
Don't you think Kallu
and her husband would fight maybe?

783
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:10,166
Why? Do you plan on getting her
divorced and then marrying her?

784
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,583
Apparently, they're planning
for a second child.

785
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,166
She doesn't even take my calls anymore.

786
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,541
-That's how busy he keeps her.
-Enough!

787
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,250
If my aunt were alive…

788
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,541
she wouldn't have agreed to this.

789
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,125
If only she were alive.

790
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,583
Don't shush me.
Your aunt helped us a great deal.

791
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,500
We need to have some gratitude.

792
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:35,166
We changed our real names
for fear of alerting your father.

793
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,083
We dug our own graves in a way.

794
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,375
Otherwise, you would've
been married to him by now.

795
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,083
Hello, Subhashini alias Prabhavathi.

796
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:45,208
We can show a lifetime
of gratitude for her help.

797
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:49,208
But no stupid theories about
marrying Chinnu, please.

798
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:52,291
You can't just assume
that he's still as aggressive.

799
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,333
Who knows?
Maybe he's a changed man now.

800
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,500
He'll never change.

801
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,041
You know it.

802
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,208
Water, please.

803
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,500
Water, sir.

804
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:31,166
-No, no.
-Have it.

805
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,583
-Open the cell.
-Okay, sir.

806
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,666
New joinee, sir.

807
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,166
New joinee.

808
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,208
Okay, sir.

809
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,000
Charulatha.

810
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:17,041
I guess you have a helping nature.

811
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,750
I love the perfume.

812
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:40,041
-Which brand is it?
-Sir?

813
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:42,333
Which perfume do you use?

814
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,958
I don't use perfume, sir.

815
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,708
What am I smelling then?

816
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,083
Is it body odor?

817
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,375
-Sudha…
-Sir.

818
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,541
Stop laughing.

819
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,833
I just found a new perfume for our car.

820
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:04,916
Talk to her.

821
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:09,333
-Hey!
-Sir! Sir! No!

822
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,125
I warned you against this.

823
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,541
We're not allowed to offer him
anything without the CI's permission.

824
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:16,750
But you didn't listen.

825
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,375
That man reminded me of my mom, sir.

826
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,875
My dad used to beat up
my mom daily for no reason.

827
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,875
We would wait in hope every day
to get out of that hell hole.

828
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,666
To be honest,
that's why I took up this job.

829
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:40,416
In the hope of doing my best
to help other women like my mom.

830
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,458
If so, you should help
everyone in that village.

831
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:48,250
Sokulapalem.

832
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,083
It used to be a criminal hub.

833
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:10,125
It's a crime-free region now.

834
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,375
They've swayed away
from crimes long ago.

835
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:22,625
But they're still paying the cost
for their ancestors' mistakes.

836
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,041
They can't find work anywhere.

837
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,375
Even if they want to get
a new job somewhere else…

838
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,625
or earn a livelihood here…

839
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,750
they need the CI's stamp of approval.

840
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:34,875
What's the problem, sir?

841
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:40,208
A few years ago, our CI's land
ended up in a court litigation.

842
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:42,541
Guess who filed the case.

843
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,125
It was his elder brother, Kurmanand.

844
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,916
Our CI was unlucky.

845
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:53,875
Kurmanand became the Corporator with
the support of the people of Sokulapalem.

846
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:57,416
He used that influence
to win the court case.

847
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,791
The verdict said
that our CI couldn't access

848
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:02,041
that land without his brother's signature.

849
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:09,583
He didn't do any good
to the people as a Corporator.

850
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,041
But our CI blamed the people
for putting him in this position.

851
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,458
He developed deep anger
for the people of Sokulapalem.

852
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:20,416
He couldn't get back at his brother
since he's politically powerful now.

853
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,583
Hence, every time he's angry with him,

854
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,458
he goes to Sokulapalem.

855
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,666
He picks one of them.

856
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:27,916
He arrests them.

857
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,333
He files odd cases on them.

858
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:30,583
He hits them.

859
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,000
He hits them.

860
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,958
He keeps hitting them.

861
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,708
Hey!

862
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,875
Has nobody ever complained against him?

863
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,916
A complaint?

864
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:42,583
Against him?

865
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,375
Against our Daya?

866
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:48,625
Look at that.

867
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,125
She waits there every day.

868
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,583
Has she stepped into the station once
and questioned him?

869
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:56,375
She won't.

870
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:57,583
It's fear.

871
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:02,333
They just hope that he cuts back
on the beating after seeing them.

872
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:07,333
That's their only battle.

873
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:16,208
SOKULAPALEM

874
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:26,208
Where does Raju live?

875
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,708
Thanks.

876
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,708
-Mom…
-Is your mom home?

877
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:37,083
Mom…

878
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:42,500
Raju hasn't eaten in five days.

879
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,791
-I know, ma'am.
-Then pack lunch quickly.

880
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:48,916
I have to go.

881
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,916
-Namaste, ma'am.
-Namaste.

882
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,791
-What do you do?
-I'm a carpenter, ma'am.

883
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,166
I run that chicken shop, ma'am.

884
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:15,833
Don't worry, I've got this.

885
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:16,875
Bye.

886
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,041
Bye.

887
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,583
Should I be happy that
he got to eat today?

888
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,333
Or should I be sad wondering how long
this will persist? I don't know.

889
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,791
None of us expected this hint
of positivity, right?

890
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,791
Look at this.

891
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,500
I hurt myself.

892
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,666
They say this is karma
for your past mistakes.

893
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:42,458
If this is the level of pain we're
subjected to for our petty mistakes…

894
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:48,208
imagine the kind of hammering that monster
is going to receive for torturing us.

895
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,750
Charu…

896
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,375
Get in. Charu, let's go.

897
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:09,958
-Did you hurt yourself at the shoot?
-Yes, sir.

898
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:12,708
Sir.

899
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,166
Here.

900
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,208
Sorry.

901
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,791
Sorry? Don't you have common sense?

902
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:45,250
-What did you say?
-I said don't you have common sense?

903
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,708
-You're supposed to be careful.
-I apologized, right?

904
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,416
Is an apology sufficient?

905
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,583
What if something happened?

906
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,625
What if something happened?

907
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,416
-Sudha, go stand there.
-Sir.

908
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,541
-Sir, don't. We're at a hospital.
-Stand behind the car. Go, go, go.

909
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,125
-Charu, come.
-Sir.

910
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,208
Stand in the center.

911
00:56:08,916 --> 00:56:10,000
If the car moves…

912
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,083
I'll kill you both.

913
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,375
What if something happened?

914
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:26,583
Sir!

915
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,125
There was a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

916
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:34,250
He used to trouble people a lot.

917
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,416
Sir, stop!

918
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,541
Who the hell are you?

919
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:32,375
An explosion waiting to happen.

920
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,958
Your car, sir. Petrol is leaking.

921
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,083
What if it catches fire
from all the thudding?

922
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,333
You'll be dead.

923
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,291
Dead beyond recognition.

924
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,333
-Check it.
-Sir.

925
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:55,750
Yes, sir. There's a leak.

926
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,125
Aunty…

927
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,500
I do have common sense.

928
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,166
Hi.

929
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,500
Your bottle cap.

930
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,000
It's not mine.

931
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:54,750
I saw what you did.

932
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,458
Thanks for saving that lady.

933
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,666
I'm Charulatha.

934
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:02,875
Surya.

935
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,083
Hello, ma'am?

936
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,083
I see that your bike ran out of fuel.

937
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,166
Come, I'll take you to the petrol pump.

938
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,458
Oh, no. It's okay.

939
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,041
I know it's okay.
That's why I offered to help.

940
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,333
Do you have a bottle to carry the petrol?

941
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:30,458
No.

942
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:36,500
Let's go.

943
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:45,625
What's wrong?

944
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,291
I guess my bike ran out of fuel now.

945
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,125
-I do have common sense.
-Sir!

946
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,166
Aunty…

947
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,958
-Dad!
-What is it now?

948
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,500
The "true anger" dream?

949
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,791
I watched a white guy's sermon just now.

950
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,708
I'll explain everything after this show.

951
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,291
No, wait. Let me watch.

952
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:15,583
-It's not that, Dad.
-Damn.

953
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,875
-Two things happened today.
-What are those?

954
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,375
-I got angry at a guy.
-It's common.

955
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,583
And I met a girl.

956
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,375
I met her and came back home.

957
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,208
I sat down to write his name
but I can't stop thinking about her.

958
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:28,625
I'm not able to pen down the name.

959
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,000
I can't seem to understand why.

960
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,375
Who's this girl?

961
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:35,750
Her name is Charulatha.

962
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,375
Charu…

963
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:39,958
Her name starts with "Cha"
just like Mom's.

964
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,375
Chayadevi. Charulatha.

965
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:44,250
Do you think that's the connection?

966
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:47,291
We have a neighbor
called Chamundeshwari.

967
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,666
Did you ever look at her
and feel this way?

968
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,958
See? It's not in the name.

969
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,750
Listen to me.

970
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,166
If there's an emotion beyond your anger…

971
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:01,000
what could it be?

972
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:03,625
What could it be?

973
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:20,750
What's happening to me?

974
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:24,041
These are joys I'm not used to

975
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:30,750
Something has nestled in my heart

976
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:34,666
My emotions change

977
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,750
My anger is calmed when I'm with you

978
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:44,125
Your intoxication lightens my heart

979
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:50,958
The heart is unlike yesterday

980
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:58,208
It doesn't respond to me when I ask why

981
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:01,541
A bubbling heart

982
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,250
And excitement in my breath

983
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:08,458
I'm drenched in
Showers of your thoughts

984
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:12,000
This connection is destined to be

985
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,333
Whispers of silence

986
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,833
Words slip away from the lips

987
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:22,208
Our imagination touches the skies

988
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:25,833
Where are we headed?

989
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,333
What's happening to me?

990
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,083
These are joys I'm not used to

991
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:32,750
He has the same name as your nephew.

992
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:36,833
But he's nothing like your Chinnu.

993
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,958
Every time I look at Charu,

994
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,125
she reminds me so much of Kallu.

995
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,833
Her smile, the way she talks, all of it.

996
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,458
I didn't have this feeling
when I met the real Kallu, Dad.

997
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,000
Simple.

998
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,250
We tend to see our loved ones
in the people we love.

999
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:56,500
Kallu is married now.

1000
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,083
So, you're thinking of the young Kallu
every time you see Charu.

1001
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,583
-Do you think he found the real Kallu?
-I don't think so.

1002
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:14,333
It feels like I'm cloaked by your thoughts

1003
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:19,666
When you smile with all your heart

1004
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:23,041
New light enters my eyes

1005
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,750
Sokulapalem is a thieves' den, right?

1006
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:29,708
I don't have any proof to prove otherwise.

1007
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,291
But they really need this insurance.

1008
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,291
Please do it for me, Surya.

1009
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:40,458
The threads of our hands are intertwined
Strengthened by fate

1010
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:44,541
We will not be separated

1011
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:48,416
But will move forward as a pair

1012
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:53,083
A bubbling heart

1013
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,583
And excitement in my breath

1014
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:59,958
I'm drenched in
Showers of your thoughts

1015
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:02,500
This connection is destined to be

1016
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:30,458
Girlfriend?

1017
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:34,833
I liked my aunt's daughter
when I was young.

1018
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,500
-But she's married now.
-Oh.

1019
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:41,666
What about you?

1020
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:47,250
The guy I'm going to marry shouldn't
even know the spelling of violence.

1021
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:48,791
Where can I find one these days?

1022
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,000
Oh, this is where you live.

1023
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,333
Please don't mind me not inviting you in.

1024
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,833
Mom might have a problem.

1025
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,291
Hey, it's totally alright.

1026
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:09,875
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, it's okay.

1027
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,583
-Bye.
-Bye.

1028
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:12,791
Charu…

1029
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:18,208
So, does the alphabet "S"
appear once or twice in the word violence?

1030
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,208
Lense… There must be an S.

1031
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,291
-Bye.
-No, I really don't know.

1032
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:24,375
Is it a single S or double S?

1033
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:31,791
Hey, she's growing fond of you
because of those six days.

1034
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,750
God forbid she finds out
about your seventh day.

1035
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,541
How will she find out?

1036
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:38,541
How will she find out?

1037
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:41,958
I got discharged yesterday, man.

1038
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,000
Sorry, ma'am.

1039
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:50,375
Forgive us for our mistake, ma'am.

1040
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,666
Hello.

1041
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,625
Look at this.

1042
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,500
Swamy, the bakery guy, and my SI.

1043
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,125
He hit all of them on a Saturday.

1044
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,458
Which means,
he hits people only on Saturdays.

1045
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,666
You're acting like Prakash Raj
from the film Tagore.

1046
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,250
You solved 90 percent of the case.

1047
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,208
Is that a joke?

1048
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,791
You don't get it.

1049
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,666
He's observing me closely.

1050
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,958
I'm worried about what
he might do in the future.

1051
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,833
Do you think that's him?

1052
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,708
-Who?
-The Saturday guy.

1053
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,666
You're overthinking this.
He's not so cool.

1054
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,125
Forget about him.

1055
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:45,708
How can I just let it go?

1056
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:49,541
How do I explain it to you?

1057
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,166
Okay.

1058
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:53,708
Take the movie Eega for example.

1059
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:55,708
Nani loves Samantha.

1060
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:57,416
Samantha loves Nani as well.

1061
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,750
But before she can express her love…

1062
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:01,875
Kiccha Sudeep kills Nani.

1063
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,958
Nani was reborn as a fly
because it's a movie.

1064
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:07,166
-But what do we do in real life?
-Yeah, not possible.

1065
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:12,166
I have a feeling that this guy
is like Kiccha Sudeep.

1066
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:14,208
You get it?

1067
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:22,916
Are you saying the
Saturday guy is Kiccha Sudeep?

1068
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,083
Yeah.

1069
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,583
-Samantha?
-That's me.

1070
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,333
Who's Nani?

1071
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:34,916
Are you crazy? You are Nani.

1072
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:38,583
-Me?
-A bubbling heart

1073
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:42,125
And excitement in my breath

1074
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:45,375
I'm drenched in
Showers of your thoughts

1075
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:49,000
This connection is destined to be

1076
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,208
Whispers of silence

1077
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,833
Words slip away from the lips

1078
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:58,625
Our imagination touches the skies

1079
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,875
Dad, she's calling.
I'll be talking to her.

1080
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,625
You keep saying, "Nani, come here.
Nani, do this, etc."

1081
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:04,958
-Nani? Who's that?
-It's me!

1082
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:09,125
Hello, I'm just at home.

1083
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:11,041
-Nani!
-Yes, Dad?

1084
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,250
Come and do the dishes.

1085
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,625
-The food is delicious?
-No, come do the dishes.

1086
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,750
Yeah, coming.

1087
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,000
THE KNOT

1088
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,500
-Don't turn right. Turn left.
-That road is bad.

1089
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,041
-I said turn left.
-Got it, brother.

1090
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:35,708
I agree what Daya did in my case is wrong.

1091
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:39,166
But he let me go before
your call came that day.

1092
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:40,791
Trust me on this once.

1093
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,416
Do we need this drama hanging over us?

1094
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,583
Sir, he's your little brother after all.

1095
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,000
He's been asking you for a long time now.

1096
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,708
Why don't you meet him
and sign the papers?

1097
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,500
-What's wrong?
-The road is blocked.

1098
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:57,958
Why is my judgment so off every time?

1099
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,625
Always the wrong judgment!

1100
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,250
But first, sir…

1101
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,041
What do we do now?

1102
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:06,875
-What?
-What do we do now?

1103
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:17,916
-Open the cell.
-Yes, sir.

1104
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,000
-Sir, sir…
-Hey! It's sharp. Get back.

1105
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,583
-Be careful, man. Don't be scared.
-Sir.

1106
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:32,833
Raju…

1107
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:34,708
Do you want to go home?

1108
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:36,875
Go.

1109
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:39,125
-Sudha, release him.
-Sir.

1110
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,625
How come, sir?

1111
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,833
My brother is giving me my land back.

1112
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,916
He's going to sign the agreement
once he's back in the city.

1113
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,750
I don't need this guy anymore.

1114
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:50,833
Dude, go.

1115
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,166
Be happy.

1116
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,541
Go, go, go.

1117
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:00,916
Go tell everyone to be happy.

1118
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,000
The agreement will be signed
on the coming Saturday.

1119
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,125
I'll get my land back.

1120
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,875
Take it off!

1121
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,541
Bro, he has a girlfriend.

1122
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,250
I'm glad.

1123
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,750
Should we get them both married?

1124
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:24,291
Brother, she doesn't know
about his Saturday concept.

1125
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,625
That means…

1126
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:36,708
he won't lift a finger in her
presence even on a Saturday.

1127
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:40,000
If he does, he'll get
into trouble with her.

1128
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:43,458
If he doesn't,
he'll get into trouble with us.

1129
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:47,916
Fantastic!

1130
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,041
The time has come to hit
him on a Saturday, Martin!

1131
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,541
Go!

1132
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,583
Take our whole gang.

1133
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,416
Let's check out his eternal love story.

1134
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:01,750
-Hey!
-Brother…

1135
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:07,291
I'm getting some surgery done tomorrow.

1136
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,500
I want to hear good news before that.

1137
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:12,166
Go, go.

1138
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,208
Mom, I'm off to work.

1139
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,708
What does he like to eat?

1140
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,041
Shall I invite him over?

1141
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:36,125
Now that she's told her mom about you,

1142
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:39,166
I think it's unfair to
hide the truth from her.

1143
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,500
True. Let's say before you confess,

1144
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:45,750
she finds out that you're
both Nani and Kiccha Sudeep,

1145
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:46,958
the movie won't be called
Eega anymore.

1146
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,458
It'd be called Gabbilam.

1147
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,000
I'm afraid about how she'll react, Dad.

1148
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:54,250
Hey…

1149
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,666
If you confess,
you'll be telling the truth.

1150
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,333
But if she finds out…

1151
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:02,250
you'll be cheating her.

1152
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,000
Think about it.

1153
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:13,583
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

1154
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,375
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

1155
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,875
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

1156
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:20,000
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

1157
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:23,333
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

1158
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:24,833
Sir, Mr. Daya is here.

1159
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,916
What did he call you? Tissue paper?

1160
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:35,916
Let that go, brother.

1161
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,291
Just sign the land papers
and be done with it.

1162
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,875
That… I…

1163
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,875
Sir.

1164
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,708
Go and ask if he would
like to have coffee or tea.

1165
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,083
Okay, sir.

1166
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:58,791
-Did you get it?
-Sir?

1167
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:00,416
Ask him.

1168
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:03,458
-Don't serve anything. Go.
-Okay, sir.

1169
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,083
Sir, would you like to have coffee or tea?

1170
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,083
Sir, shall I order coffee?

1171
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,958
-One coffee and one tea.
-Okay, sir.

1172
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:15,291
-And one water bottle.
-Okay, sir.

1173
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:21,791
Why do you sound so serious and formal?

1174
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,041
-What is this about?
-I'll tell you when we meet.

1175
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:26,333
You're going to meet Mom
and me in the evening anyway.

1176
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,500
Yeah, I want to meet you once before that.

1177
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:31,916
Okay.

1178
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,291
Sir, coffee or tea?

1179
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,875
Hey, we ordered half an hour ago.

1180
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,791
-Sorry, sir. I totally forgot.
-What?

1181
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:57,125
-One coffee, one tea, and a water bottle.
-Okay, sir.

1182
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:59,541
Also, tell him that Daya sir is waiting.

1183
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,583
-Okay, sir.
-Yes.

1184
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,208
Sir, would you like to have coffee or tea?

1185
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:25,000
Are you guys kidding me?
How many times do we…

1186
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:30,541
One coffee.

1187
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,375
One tea.

1188
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,291
And a water bottle if you may.

1189
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:39,625
-Hello.
-Who's next?

1190
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:43,833
-Bro, I'm sending Kumar in.
-Go ahead.

1191
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,375
Sir, would you like to have coffee or tea?

1192
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,416
Choose your words wisely.

1193
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,625
-Is that him? Let's go!
-Hurry up! Go, go, go!

1194
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:01,083
I'm sure it was deliberate.

1195
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:04,333
We made a huge mistake
by letting Govardhan go that day.

1196
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,708
Otherwise…

1197
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,375
Let's go.

1198
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,208
Get inside! Go! Go!

1199
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,333
Please don't hit me, sir.

1200
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:31,166
Please, don't hit me.

1201
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:47,625
-What's the update?
-She's not here yet.

1202
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,541
You should attack him
only in her presence.

1203
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,125
Otherwise, he'll wreak havoc on you guys.

1204
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,125
Alright.

1205
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,333
You dare to have his picture?

1206
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:04,000
-Do you think so highly of him?
-Sir, no!

1207
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:09,625
Sir, please don't hit him. He'll die!
Sir, please stop! Sir!

1208
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,375
-Sir, please stop!
-Mom!

1209
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:15,875
-Sir, let me go.
-Sir, please let go of my dad.

1210
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,625
Sir, let her go!

1211
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,333
Lalli!

1212
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:26,833
Lalli!

1213
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,333
Lalli!

1214
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,208
I think the little girl is hurt.

1215
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:32,583
Hey!

1216
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,291
I'll kill you if you move forward.

1217
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:42,625
He invited me home on the premise
of giving my land back…

1218
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,166
Lalli!

1219
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:47,041
and went on to humiliate me further.

1220
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,875
How could you paint such a man's picture?

1221
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:56,666
Hello, where are you? It's been a while.

1222
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,666
-Why did you paint his picture?
-Lalitha…

1223
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,291
If I hear his name again,

1224
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:04,833
-I'll turn Sokulapalem into a graveyard.
-Lalitha.

1225
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,083
Trust me!

1226
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:25,750
Oh, dear!

1227
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:27,500
Dear!

1228
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,291
Brother, somebody, help!

1229
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:31,125
He left.

1230
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,583
Somebody, help!

1231
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,208
Somebody, please come forward.

1232
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,375
My girl is going to die.

1233
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,333
Lalli…

1234
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:45,625
Lalli…

1235
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:48,666
Lalli!

1236
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,250
How is she doing?

1237
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:34,708
They're checking.

1238
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:49,166
It's high time that you file a complaint.

1239
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:52,000
I'm talking to you.

1240
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:57,833
File a complaint and kill her
chances of survival completely?

1241
01:20:58,666 --> 01:20:59,625
I don't want that.

1242
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,625
We're used to this misery.

1243
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,166
How can you say that?

1244
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,875
If you file a complaint, this
won't happen to someone else.

1245
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,375
If only the people before
us took some action,

1246
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,166
we wouldn't be subjected
to this suffering now.

1247
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,083
Why should we worry about someone else?

1248
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,666
We're all united in fear.

1249
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,000
Not in fighting that demon.

1250
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,791
Where is your CI right now?

1251
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,500
What will you do about it, Surya?

1252
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:47,583
This isn't as easy as saving
that woman by spilling petrol.

1253
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:55,958
All we can do is listen,
watch, and sit in agony.

1254
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,625
We're hopeless.

1255
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:02,958
Today is a Saturday.

1256
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,458
You know what I feel right now?

1257
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:10,000
If that Saturday guy were here…

1258
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:14,625
right now, standing in front of me…

1259
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,958
I would want to ask him for a favor.

1260
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:25,750
Ask.

1261
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,041
I told you he won't lift a finger
in her presence even on a Saturday.

1262
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:53,125
He, the one who breaks
The shackles of doubt

1263
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:56,041
With a fierce and intense gaze

1264
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,916
His nails are like blazing
Flames on a mountain

1265
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,791
He is the constant force
Of balance on a Saturday

1266
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:02,875
Ask.

1267
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:29,000
This is a fight between you and me.
Why did you guys touch her?

1268
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:13,041
I can express anger only one day a week.

1269
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,333
My mom took this promise from me.

1270
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:21,125
That's the deal with Saturday.

1271
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,000
Only on a Saturday.

1272
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:22,916
I don't know what favor you wanted to ask.

1273
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:29,958
But I got angry.

1274
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:31,833
And because I'm angry,

1275
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,916
this problem just became my problem.

1276
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:37,958
Sokulapalem is my family now.

1277
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:18,041
I have to go to work in the morning.

1278
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:19,833
We don't have an off day.

1279
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:21,791
You don't work on Sundays, right?

1280
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:23,500
I guess so.

1281
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:29,708
I hope the girl will be fine.

1282
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,625
What did you say his name was?

1283
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,333
Oh.

1284
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:42,583
Daya.

1285
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:44,791
Daya.

1286
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:52,666
SOKULAPALEM

1287
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:56,625
There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

1288
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:57,833
Come, come!

1289
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,958
He used to trouble people a lot.

1290
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:11,375
So Sri Krishna and
Satyabhama teamed up and…

1291
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:15,416
killed him!

1292
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:24,000
The sound of crackling
It's like the roaring of the sky

1293
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:26,458
Here's to the fall of the mighty ones
The blazing ground is scorched

1294
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,958
The battle that cannot be unseen
Blood has already begun to boil

1295
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:31,625
The war has tipped the balance
Destruction is inevitable

1296
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:34,000
You've played a big game.

1297
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:42,875
The war has tipped the balance
Destruction is inevitable

1298
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:46,833
You've played a big game.

1299
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:52,208
CROSSROADS

1300
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,708
Bhadru, how are your sugar levels?

1301
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:58,916
You're in your ninth month.

1302
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,125
Tell your family at least now.

1303
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,000
Did you eat?

1304
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,625
How long will you keep avoiding this?

1305
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,666
Don't act so stubborn.

1306
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,041
You lied about going to Bangalore
and stayed back in the same city.

1307
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:12,875
What's the need to live at
your friend's place like this?

1308
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:14,625
I'm not with you during a time like this.

1309
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,583
I feel guilty
to leave you all by yourself.

1310
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:19,208
Think about it.

1311
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:25,541
Hey…

1312
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:27,750
Did you tell her?

1313
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:29,791
Yeah.

1314
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:30,958
What did she say?

1315
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:34,083
She left without saying a word.

1316
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:35,250
She left?

1317
01:29:36,166 --> 01:29:37,875
Did you tell her properly or not?

1318
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,875
I didn't just tell her.

1319
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,333
I showed her.

1320
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:42,708
What do you mean?

1321
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:46,583
I don't know what to do, Mom.

1322
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:50,666
He's the kind of guy
I didn't want in my life.

1323
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,708
But I fell in love with the same guy.

1324
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,291
Even though I know the truth,

1325
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,750
I don't feel like losing him.

1326
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:04,125
Is it the situation…

1327
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:07,291
or is it my love for him?

1328
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:12,000
I just don't understand.

1329
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,041
SUNDAY

1330
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:15,875
Thanks for understanding.

1331
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:21,583
What do you plan on doing this Saturday?

1332
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,416
So you're going to hit the CI, right?

1333
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,041
You said the people of Sokulapalem
are family, and this is your problem now.

1334
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,791
Hitting him may calm your anger.

1335
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:40,541
But that doesn't mean
their problem will be solved.

1336
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:48,041
I don't know if I can say this
to someone who helped us.

1337
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:51,125
Never help us again.

1338
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:53,750
If something happens to you going forward,

1339
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:55,750
that will affect us only.

1340
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:59,083
Look what happened to that girl.

1341
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,166
Did anyone come forward to help?

1342
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:05,333
I'm one to speak.
Did I come forward to help?

1343
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:11,541
We've gotten used to the fear.

1344
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:14,958
We'll never change.

1345
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
This is it.

1346
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:20,208
We'll never change.

1347
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,416
Our lives are doomed.

1348
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,375
MONDAY

1349
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:29,500
I don't know what happened there.

1350
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:32,541
But it's highly impossible to go
ahead without your brother's signature.

1351
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:33,750
The clients are adamant.

1352
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,375
They want to buy the land before
Sunday or move on to another seller.

1353
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:38,875
It's not going to work
out with Kurmanand, sir.

1354
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,791
If you were there, you'd never
have coffee or tea again in your life.

1355
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:42,958
What do we do then?

1356
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,375
Sir, as long as your brother's here,
we need his signature.

1357
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:49,666
What if he isn't?

1358
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,000
What if my brother is no more?

1359
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:00,875
What are you talking about, sir?

1360
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:03,000
-It's Kurmanand, sir.
-To hell with him!

1361
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:11,500
You'll get the news
before the coming Sunday.

1362
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,583
Before the coming Sunday.

1363
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:22,166
Daya is planning to kill his brother.

1364
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,958
We just have to make sure
Kurmanand finds out about this.

1365
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:30,791
Then Kurmanand will deal with Daya.

1366
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,208
Do you think that's going to solve
Sokulapalem's problem?

1367
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:37,208
Dayanand is their only problem.

1368
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:39,958
Daya isn't the only problem.

1369
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,916
It's the fear that's rooted in them.

1370
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:47,041
Let's say Daya is gone.

1371
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,666
Tomorrow, some other
evil guy will take over.

1372
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:51,625
The fear will come back.

1373
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:54,125
That fear should disappear.

1374
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:59,166
And for that to happen,
they need a ray of hope in their lives.

1375
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:00,625
But how?

1376
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:05,375
Even if one guy from Sokulapalem
steps forward with courage…

1377
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:07,791
all their lives will change.

1378
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,375
Courage from the people of Sokulapalem?

1379
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:11,625
It doesn't have to be one of them.

1380
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:17,958
They just need to believe
that one of them already did.

1381
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:21,166
Isn't that enough?

1382
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,708
TUESDAY

1383
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:53,291
Who is this guy?

1384
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:58,625
"My patience has worn out.
My tears have dried out.

1385
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,041
On behalf of all of us,

1386
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:04,708
I want to overcome the fear
and take a step forward.

1387
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,000
I'll take the first step this Saturday.

1388
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,250
One of us."

1389
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:10,250
Who is this guy?

1390
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:12,791
Who could it be?

1391
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,125
One of us?

1392
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,458
It's not me, bro.

1393
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:19,750
What could the first step be?

1394
01:34:23,041 --> 01:34:24,541
And why Saturday?

1395
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:26,625
Who could it be?

1396
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,541
He said he'll take the first step.

1397
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:31,375
Maybe he'll massage his feet
for these four days.

1398
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,583
Am I right, sir?
Am I right, ma'am?

1399
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:35,666
Have some shame!

1400
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:39,291
Don't you see our pain in those words?

1401
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:41,666
Keep watching.

1402
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:43,291
This Saturday…

1403
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:46,166
our lives are going to change.

1404
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:47,750
Because of one of us.

1405
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:54,833
There are only two common spots
in Kurmanand's routine, sir.

1406
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:56,583
He goes to the temple at 10:00 a.m.

1407
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:01,166
He goes to the pub at 11:00 p.m.

1408
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:10,000
But more people escort him
to the pub than the temple.

1409
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:12,708
So security-wise,
the temple is a better spot.

1410
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,625
Which temple does he go to?

1411
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,416
A different temple every day,
depending on which day it is.

1412
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:18,458
Shivalayam on Mondays,
Hanuman temple on Tuesdays,

1413
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:19,708
Ayyappa temple on Wednesdays.

1414
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:22,250
Sai Baba temple on Thursdays,
Gayatri temple on Fridays,

1415
01:35:22,333 --> 01:35:23,333
and on Saturdays…

1416
01:35:23,916 --> 01:35:24,916
Balaji temple.

1417
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:28,458
Balaji temple.

1418
01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:29,416
WEDNESDAY

1419
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,541
But the catch is he's flying
to Delhi Thursday night.

1420
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:33,375
He won't be back until next Wednesday.

1421
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:37,125
Sir, we told the clients that the
agreement will be done by Sunday.

1422
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:39,916
If we postpone it, they'll
cancel the deal altogether.

1423
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:41,875
What do we do, sir?

1424
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:45,166
They're planning something at
the Sai Baba temple tomorrow.

1425
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,791
We'll move the plan to Saturday.

1426
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But how?

1427
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:54,625
Surya, my boy!

1428
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,333
Sir, I found the Chief Guest
for our 25th anniversary.

1429
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,458
You did?

1430
01:35:58,708 --> 01:35:59,583
Who's that?

1431
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:00,625
25th Anniversary?

1432
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:01,583
THURSDAY

1433
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:03,458
-Nice card.
-I designed it, sir.

1434
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,125
But I can't make it.
I'm going to Delhi.

1435
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,083
Sir, he'll explain
the agenda in two minutes.

1436
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,583
I'm going to the temple.
I'll see you in the evening.

1437
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:11,291
-He's going to the temple.
-He's saying evening.

1438
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:12,333
Sir!

1439
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:14,333
You don't come.

1440
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:18,166
But please listen to the
speech I prepared for you.

1441
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:19,958
It's up to you to go to Delhi or not.

1442
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,583
Once you hear the speech,
you'll never go to Delhi again.

1443
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:24,750
Costly flowers, sir.

1444
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Ma'am, give me two rupees, please.
You're so beautiful.

1445
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:34,500
Ma'am! God will bless you.

1446
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:35,750
Hey!

1447
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:41,541
Thank you, sir.

1448
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:44,125
Why did you give 500 rupees, sir?

1449
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:47,208
Our work gets done quickly when
we do such things once in a while.

1450
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:56,083
Sir, the prayer is almost done.
I don't think he's coming.

1451
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,375
Greetings, sir.

1452
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:08,750
Go.

1453
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,000
Go!

1454
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:13,208
-Find out what happened.
-Sir.

1455
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,666
-Nice.
-Thank you, sir.

1456
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:20,333
What was that? It's selfish of me…

1457
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:22,708
to wish for your wellness
when I'm in power.

1458
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:23,708
FRIDAY

1459
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:26,875
But it's my responsibility to wish for
your wellness even when I'm not in power.

1460
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:30,583
He postponed his Delhi
trip to next Monday for this.

1461
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:33,416
Our only option now is this Saturday.

1462
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:38,833
Saturday.

1463
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:52,666
If we miss him at the temple,
what can we do at the bar that night?

1464
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:55,125
This is our only chance, Surya.

1465
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:57,166
If we miss this…

1466
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:03,250
We won't miss it!

1467
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,166
I won't let it happen.

1468
01:38:16,666 --> 01:38:20,208
SATURDAY

1469
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:28,875
Hey, Kali…

1470
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:31,291
Your father was doing
well when you were here.

1471
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,500
Some guy Surya…

1472
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,666
He got me so worked up.

1473
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:38,291
Don't spare him!

1474
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,458
Inspector…

1475
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:15,916
-Yes, uncle?
-Listen.

1476
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,583
-Who's Inspector Daya?
-He's a psycho case. Why?

1477
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:21,833
This madman has written down his name.

1478
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,125
I don't know what to do.

1479
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,041
Should I go tell Daya
that he's coming to hit him?

1480
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:29,916
And ask him to be careful, maybe?

1481
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:33,375
Will you warn a cop that
your son is going to hit him?

1482
01:39:33,916 --> 01:39:35,166
What do you want me to do then?

1483
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:37,541
Uncle…

1484
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:51,583
Dear…

1485
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:52,833
drink this.

1486
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,958
-Sudha.
-Sir, he's on the way.

1487
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:09,208
Go, go.

1488
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,083
Dear…

1489
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:45,208
"Daya started!"

1490
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,125
Dad…

1491
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:49,458
Dad what?

1492
01:40:50,416 --> 01:40:51,500
Go back to sleep.

1493
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:10,583
I told you to tell me when
someone messes with Dad.

1494
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,166
So?

1495
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:14,583
Who the hell is Surya?

1496
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:25,250
Where's Surya?

1497
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:26,333
-Where is he?
-Surya…

1498
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:28,875
Come here. Come.

1499
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:31,500
Why did you get a gang?
Shooting something?

1500
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:33,625
Where's Surya?

1501
01:41:34,333 --> 01:41:35,208
What day is it today?

1502
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:36,625
Saturday.

1503
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:38,375
He doesn't come to work
even on my orders.

1504
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:39,750
Do you think he'll show up for you?

1505
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:42,041
What's that scar on the face?

1506
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:44,083
We have a special policy for that.

1507
01:41:44,791 --> 01:41:45,833
Come.

1508
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,000
Where's Surya?

1509
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:50,583
I don't know.

1510
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:54,875
Scoot the knife back a little.
I don't have an insurance policy.

1511
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:03,333
-Yes?
-Narayana Prabha is dead.

1512
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:05,166
His men are looking for Surya.

1513
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:06,250
They shouldn't find him.

1514
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:07,333
Hey!

1515
01:42:07,583 --> 01:42:08,833
He has fallen asleep.

1516
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:11,041
-What do you want me to do?
-How can I tell you?

1517
01:42:11,791 --> 01:42:13,375
They'll be coming home. Do something.

1518
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:14,666
Okay, hang up!

1519
01:42:16,166 --> 01:42:17,625
Him and his stupid ideas!

1520
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:22,041
Surya… Surya…

1521
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:23,416
Wake up!

1522
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,375
Dad…

1523
01:42:59,833 --> 01:43:01,208
Dad…

1524
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,625
-Hey! You're supposed to watch the road!
-Sorry, sir.

1525
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:36,666
Start the car!

1526
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:40,083
Sir, he's at the temple.

1527
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:41,125
Where are you?

1528
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:45,708
Start the vehicle!

1529
01:43:46,458 --> 01:43:48,708
Sir, sir, sir…
I'm trying!

1530
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:50,875
-Hey, auto! Stop, stop!
-Sir!

1531
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:52,750
Take me to the Balaji temple.

1532
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:54,666
I have to pick the school kids.
Who are you, sir?

1533
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:56,416
Do as I say. Go!

1534
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,458
Go fast!

1535
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:05,291
Sir, he's leaving! Come fast!

1536
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:07,791
I'm coming, Sudha! I'm coming!

1537
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:08,958
I'm coming, Sudha!

1538
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:13,166
Uncle, can you please move?

1539
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:14,958
Hey! I'll punch you! Move!

1540
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:16,291
Stop!

1541
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:26,291
Bro, nobody knows.

1542
01:44:27,083 --> 01:44:28,791
Where else did you see him?

1543
01:44:35,333 --> 01:44:37,291
You should've come a little sooner.

1544
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:40,583
The pub is our last hope.

1545
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:41,708
But…

1546
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:49,958
Our car is starting, sir.

1547
01:44:50,625 --> 01:44:51,541
You…

1548
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:53,750
Get the keys.

1549
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:57,250
Go!

1550
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:58,458
Go! Go!

1551
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,791
The pub is our last option, sir.

1552
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:04,625
But it's difficult to get
through the security and go in.

1553
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:23,583
You should be really
careful in the next two to three weeks.

1554
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:25,083
Is none of your family here?

1555
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:27,125
Think about it.

1556
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:29,125
Forget about your brother.

1557
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:31,333
At least tell your dad.

1558
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:33,125
Do you understand me?

1559
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:50,000
Someone said there's going to
be a miraculous change soon.

1560
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:51,250
What happened?

1561
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:53,916
Nobody here has the guts, Uncle.

1562
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:57,041
Listen to me. Don't be delusional.

1563
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:59,083
Saturday and change, my foot!

1564
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I guess he's here.

1565
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:14,375
It's some woman.

1566
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:15,958
Should we tell her the house is locked?

1567
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:18,791
Why? Can't she see for herself?

1568
01:46:30,333 --> 01:46:32,250
-Hello.
-Hello, Dad. Where are you?

1569
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:33,541
The front door is locked.

1570
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,250
-Wait, are you here?
-Yeah.

1571
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:38,458
What are you doing
here at this time?

1572
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:39,750
What happened, Dad?

1573
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:41,916
It's your brother's usual mess.

1574
01:46:42,083 --> 01:46:43,041
No, what happened?

1575
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:45,000
-Is nobody outside?
-No.

1576
01:46:45,666 --> 01:46:48,250
-Enter from the back door.
-So you're inside?

1577
01:46:48,333 --> 01:46:50,416
Just come in. I'll explain later.

1578
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:52,125
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

1579
01:47:00,291 --> 01:47:01,333
You're pregnant?

1580
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:05,041
What is she doing in front of
a locked house for so long?

1581
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:09,583
Why did you keep it from me
when it was him you fought with?

1582
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:10,875
Why did you show up now?

1583
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:12,916
You should've directly come with the baby.

1584
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:15,666
Bangalore, Mattigadda,
were all lies, right?

1585
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:17,541
-Dad…
-Don't talk to me!

1586
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:18,916
You're no different from him.

1587
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,583
-How did you come?
-In my car.

1588
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,291
Bloody car! Where did you park it?

1589
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:27,375
Outside.

1590
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:29,625
Outside--

1591
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:33,083
What happened, Dad?

1592
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:37,333
Hey!

1593
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,041
This guy is home!

1594
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:46,625
Surya… Surya…

1595
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:50,708
Surya, wake up!

1596
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:25,833
Stop!

1597
01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:29,166
Surya…

1598
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:35,208
Surya…

1599
01:48:45,583 --> 01:48:46,541
Surya!

1600
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,333
Do you know what true anger means?

1601
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:01,916
Surya!

1602
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:03,916
Surya!

1603
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:06,375
Kill him, guys!

1604
01:49:13,916 --> 01:49:14,833
Chinnu…

1605
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:55,958
Why didn't you tell me?

1606
01:50:58,541 --> 01:50:59,958
Am I a stranger to you now?

1607
01:52:07,375 --> 01:52:08,458
Hey!

1608
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:19,125
Bhadra! What happened, dear?

1609
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:53,750
Surya!

1610
01:52:54,083 --> 01:52:54,958
Surya!

1611
01:53:10,541 --> 01:53:11,958
-Careful, dear.
-Come.

1612
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:51,666
Come and get her.

1613
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:51,541
My father fell under a running
train and passed away, sir.

1614
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:56,541
That is why I like to set
every clock ten minutes ahead.

1615
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:26,750
Hey!

1616
01:56:38,541 --> 01:56:42,375
We just have to let Kurma
know that Daya is trying to kill him.

1617
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:44,125
Kurma will handle Daya.

1618
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:31,333
Hey! Come, come.

1619
01:58:31,958 --> 01:58:32,833
Come!

1620
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:34,625
He hit Daya!

1621
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:37,333
One of us hit Daya, Uncle.

1622
01:58:39,333 --> 01:58:41,083
He wore a mask and hit him!

1623
01:58:44,916 --> 01:58:46,458
Missed by an inch!

1624
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:49,916
My brother…

1625
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:53,000
Your brother's men
would be looking for us, sir.

1626
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:55,041
I'll find a hideout for us.

1627
01:58:57,208 --> 01:58:58,541
My brother tried to…

1628
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:02,083
One of us hit him!

1629
01:59:03,791 --> 01:59:05,708
Somebody hit our CI?

1630
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,125
Find him!

1631
01:59:23,625 --> 01:59:26,291
Say it, Dad.
Tell me that nothing happened.

1632
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:30,583
You asked me why I kept
my pregnancy from you, right?

1633
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:33,416
If I did, I wouldn't have
made it to the ninth month.

1634
01:59:35,458 --> 01:59:39,208
When a guy like him is in the
family, why would I tell you?

1635
01:59:40,625 --> 01:59:41,666
One last thing, Dad.

1636
01:59:42,375 --> 01:59:44,083
If you want me to live with you…

1637
01:59:44,458 --> 01:59:48,458
he should give up his Saturday fights.

1638
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:54,166
I don't care if you think
of this as blackmail.

1639
01:59:55,791 --> 01:59:57,500
He said whether it's a baby boy or a girl,

1640
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,333
it's Mom coming back to us.

1641
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,458
Ask him if he can
do it for Mom at least.

1642
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:13,916
Light that guides through the darkness

1643
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:17,583
Awakening the dawn

1644
02:00:17,791 --> 02:00:24,666
With every step
Are you moving forward or just beginning?

1645
02:00:25,083 --> 02:00:28,333
It's just a caterpillar during origin

1646
02:00:28,666 --> 02:00:32,125
And then it transforms into a butterfly

1647
02:00:32,333 --> 02:00:38,708
Have the patience to grow wings

1648
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,500
Why do I feel like he's
the one who hit Daya?

1649
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:50,125
-What? Him?
-Yes.

1650
02:00:50,833 --> 02:00:51,750
Look properly!

1651
02:00:52,666 --> 02:00:53,666
You think so?

1652
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:57,166
Look how he's squeezing the garments.

1653
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:59,500
I have a feeling it's him who hit Daya.

1654
02:00:59,708 --> 02:01:00,708
It's strange, Uncle.

1655
02:01:01,375 --> 02:01:04,041
Whoever I see is giving me
the feeling that they hit Daya.

1656
02:01:04,208 --> 02:01:05,291
Namaste, Uncle.

1657
02:01:05,541 --> 02:01:07,125
You also look like that to me.

1658
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:12,541
What lies in which path?

1659
02:01:12,791 --> 02:01:15,583
You and Dad should
take care of your sister.

1660
02:01:17,458 --> 02:01:19,166
What? Where are you going?

1661
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,833
I need to go now to
come back to you, right?

1662
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:28,750
Unknowingly, it is revealing something

1663
02:01:30,541 --> 02:01:37,500
Is it showing some destination?

1664
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:41,875
Words that cannot be crossed
And mistakes that cannot be corrected

1665
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,500
As you try to change that
The path changes

1666
02:01:45,583 --> 02:01:49,208
Fate gives it to you with companionship

1667
02:01:49,416 --> 02:01:52,833
A game played without being seen

1668
02:02:10,333 --> 02:02:12,958
-What now? Should I thank you?
-I didn't ask you to.

1669
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:15,041
I won't thank you even if you ask.

1670
02:02:15,666 --> 02:02:16,541
Thanks.

1671
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,416
I have the doctor's appointment tomorrow.

1672
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:20,833
Can you take me?

1673
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:30,083
A wave is less intimidating
When you dive deep

1674
02:02:30,541 --> 02:02:36,916
It's okay to listen to your heart
It doesn't make you small

1675
02:02:37,125 --> 02:02:39,875
Time is an illusion

1676
02:02:40,625 --> 02:02:43,500
Is it going to lead the way?

1677
02:02:44,166 --> 02:02:47,333
The silence within you

1678
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:50,333
Fills a bundle of hope

1679
02:02:50,541 --> 02:02:56,416
A turn has come, oh a turn has come

1680
02:02:57,666 --> 02:03:00,500
Where will this turn lead?

1681
02:03:01,416 --> 02:03:05,166
A turn has come, oh a turn has come

1682
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,708
HIDE AND SEEK

1683
02:03:51,125 --> 02:03:52,125
Why?

1684
02:03:54,083 --> 02:03:55,250
Why did you do it?

1685
02:03:56,708 --> 02:03:57,958
What have I done to you?

1686
02:03:59,791 --> 02:04:01,500
Was it for insulting you at
my house the other day?

1687
02:04:02,125 --> 02:04:05,250
Or for making you go in circles around
me for that piece of land? Why?

1688
02:04:10,541 --> 02:04:11,916
Why did you save me?

1689
02:04:14,083 --> 02:04:15,083
Tell me.

1690
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:24,625
Did I ever treat you like my brother?

1691
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:26,416
Never.

1692
02:04:28,083 --> 02:04:30,250
Why do you love this mad person so much?

1693
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
What have I done?

1694
02:04:33,625 --> 02:04:35,458
You got yourself hurt.

1695
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:37,125
Why?

1696
02:04:39,125 --> 02:04:41,250
We may have a lot of differences.

1697
02:04:42,333 --> 02:04:43,458
But you're my big brother.

1698
02:04:45,208 --> 02:04:46,416
Nobody can change that.

1699
02:04:50,541 --> 02:04:52,000
Sir, coffee, tea.

1700
02:04:53,458 --> 02:04:54,333
Sir.

1701
02:04:54,416 --> 02:04:55,291
Here…

1702
02:04:55,666 --> 02:04:56,750
-Water bottle, sir.
-Coffee--

1703
02:04:57,958 --> 02:04:58,958
Have it.

1704
02:05:00,291 --> 02:05:01,208
Have it.

1705
02:05:09,375 --> 02:05:11,791
You see how much
my brother loves me, Govi?

1706
02:05:12,166 --> 02:05:13,458
I've known since day one.

1707
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:15,500
He let me go that day
before you called him.

1708
02:05:16,333 --> 02:05:18,666
You've always misunderstood him.

1709
02:05:19,333 --> 02:05:22,041
Wrong judgment!

1710
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:24,083
I kept you away
for so long because of it.

1711
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:26,250
But this will never
happen again. I promise.

1712
02:05:26,458 --> 02:05:28,708
If he went to such lengths
to save you, why did he hide?

1713
02:05:31,041 --> 02:05:32,125
For me…

1714
02:05:33,375 --> 02:05:35,250
what's more important than
living with my brother…

1715
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:37,791
is his being alive.

1716
02:05:38,208 --> 02:05:40,833
Your answer has nothing
to do with what I asked.

1717
02:05:41,166 --> 02:05:46,750
You all kept me and my brother
away for so long with this attitude.

1718
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:52,416
You're so doubtful, you would've
mistaken me for the killer.

1719
02:05:55,791 --> 02:05:57,500
-Water.
-Bro, it's not like that.

1720
02:05:57,625 --> 02:05:59,250
Shut up, you rascal!

1721
02:05:59,875 --> 02:06:01,500
You and your bloody doubts!

1722
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:03,666
You moron! Just shut your mouth!

1723
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:06,208
You take it.

1724
02:06:07,541 --> 02:06:10,333
Take this house, the land,
everything. I don't want it.

1725
02:06:11,666 --> 02:06:12,541
Take it.

1726
02:06:13,958 --> 02:06:14,875
Brother…

1727
02:06:17,375 --> 02:06:18,333
What did you say?

1728
02:06:19,166 --> 02:06:20,166
Brother…

1729
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:22,625
Brother.

1730
02:06:25,166 --> 02:06:28,083
This is enough for a lifetime.
My brother saved me.

1731
02:06:28,958 --> 02:06:30,000
This is enough for me.

1732
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,291
Hey! Don't cry!

1733
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:36,875
I want one thing though.

1734
02:06:41,333 --> 02:06:44,250
The guy who's been trying to kill me.

1735
02:06:45,625 --> 02:06:48,583
The guy who hurt my
brother who came to save me.

1736
02:06:51,791 --> 02:06:53,208
Don't spare him!

1737
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:56,541
I won't, brother!

1738
02:06:57,583 --> 02:06:59,125
I won't spare him, for your sake.

1739
02:07:17,166 --> 02:07:18,250
How is…

1740
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:19,916
everyone?

1741
02:07:22,916 --> 02:07:25,458
Surya, it didn't turn out as we planned.

1742
02:07:25,833 --> 02:07:27,125
I don't get it.

1743
02:07:27,291 --> 02:07:29,291
Both of them are looking for you now.

1744
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:32,083
Anything might happen at any time.

1745
02:07:33,375 --> 02:07:34,708
You also said your sister is pregnant.

1746
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,416
Let's not risk it.

1747
02:07:37,416 --> 02:07:38,541
Listen to me.

1748
02:07:39,166 --> 02:07:41,750
-Leave town urgently.
-And?

1749
02:07:43,166 --> 02:07:44,708
They won't spare me
anyway once they identify me.

1750
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:46,916
What were you planning on doing then?

1751
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:49,666
Whoever that guy is,

1752
02:07:49,833 --> 02:07:51,791
in a way he helped us a lot, sir.

1753
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,041
Even if we don't find him,

1754
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:56,125
we could take a phony to
your brother in his place.

1755
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:58,250
We'll hit the jackpot, sir.

1756
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,083
Why didn't I think of this?

1757
02:08:06,541 --> 02:08:08,083
-What was that?
-Jackpot, sir.

1758
02:08:14,541 --> 02:08:16,250
-How does it feel?
-It hurts, sir.

1759
02:08:16,875 --> 02:08:17,958
It hurts like hell, sir.

1760
02:08:24,166 --> 02:08:26,333
Wipe it. Here you go.

1761
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:30,416
-Did the pain go down?
-No, sir. No.

1762
02:08:30,916 --> 02:08:33,416
Money doesn't heal the pain, does it?

1763
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:34,875
No, sir.

1764
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:36,208
Then how will I…

1765
02:08:37,333 --> 02:08:39,000
He hit me, Sudha.

1766
02:08:40,166 --> 02:08:42,708
And you say he helped us?!

1767
02:08:53,166 --> 02:08:55,750
He raised his hand.

1768
02:08:57,083 --> 02:08:58,583
He was about to punch me.

1769
02:09:00,208 --> 02:09:01,125
But then he stopped.

1770
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:02,916
Walked away.

1771
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,500
Came back and punched me this time.

1772
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:10,041
Why did he stop the first time?

1773
02:09:10,708 --> 02:09:12,500
Why did he come back and punch me?

1774
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,916
What happened in the meantime?

1775
02:09:24,375 --> 02:09:25,291
Hey!

1776
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:35,666
What has he done?

1777
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:42,250
There's some connection between
the clock and landing the punch.

1778
02:09:43,875 --> 02:09:47,750
There's some connection between
the clock and landing the punch.

1779
02:09:47,833 --> 02:09:49,333
-We need to find out.
-I'll figure it out, sir.

1780
02:09:54,875 --> 02:09:56,291
-So, you checked it.
-Sir.

1781
02:09:58,041 --> 02:10:01,416
The clock is ten minutes ahead.

1782
02:10:01,583 --> 02:10:02,458
Sir.

1783
02:10:03,125 --> 02:10:04,958
So what if it's ten minutes ahead?

1784
02:10:06,708 --> 02:10:08,125
-Sir… I don't know.
-You don't know?

1785
02:10:12,083 --> 02:10:13,666
He didn't know either.

1786
02:10:14,625 --> 02:10:16,250
He assumed the clock
struck twelve and stopped.

1787
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:19,125
When he found out,
he came back to punch me.

1788
02:10:19,708 --> 02:10:22,041
So what if the clock struck twelve?

1789
02:10:22,875 --> 02:10:25,083
The day just changed, sir.

1790
02:10:25,375 --> 02:10:29,208
It's a Sunday then.

1791
02:10:30,083 --> 02:10:31,625
So he doesn't hit on Sundays?

1792
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:33,541
Who would be so weird, sir?

1793
02:10:33,625 --> 02:10:36,083
I'm sure he's capable of that.

1794
02:10:38,166 --> 02:10:39,666
Who is it, Sudha?

1795
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:45,875
The guy who hit you
also wore a mask, right?

1796
02:10:46,583 --> 02:10:48,375
He put a mask on me and hit me, sir.

1797
02:10:48,583 --> 02:10:51,041
Whatever! He hit you, right?

1798
02:10:51,125 --> 02:10:52,333
-Yes, sir.
-What day was it?

1799
02:10:52,708 --> 02:10:54,208
I think it's on 25th…

1800
02:10:54,333 --> 02:10:55,833
Enough of your English!
I'll break your jaw!

1801
02:10:56,125 --> 02:10:57,041
What day was it?

1802
02:10:57,416 --> 02:11:00,625
-Friday or Saturday… It was the…
-Twenty…

1803
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:02,791
-It was the 24th.
-Saturday!

1804
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:04,750
Absolutely, sir.

1805
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:06,125
Saturday.

1806
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:14,250
He hit the both of us on a Saturday.

1807
02:11:16,041 --> 02:11:17,791
There are two possibilities, Sudha.

1808
02:11:19,916 --> 02:11:23,541
He either stays under
the radar on Sundays…

1809
02:11:23,625 --> 02:11:27,458
and goes all out from Monday to Saturday.

1810
02:11:27,625 --> 02:11:28,541
Or…

1811
02:11:31,416 --> 02:11:34,000
He goes all out only on Saturdays.

1812
02:11:36,458 --> 02:11:38,708
-Now it makes sense, Sudha.
-Sir…

1813
02:11:40,625 --> 02:11:45,500
I want details about FIRs filed
on Saturdays in all the stations.

1814
02:11:45,583 --> 02:11:46,500
Okay, sir.

1815
02:11:51,791 --> 02:11:53,166
It's enough indeed.

1816
02:11:54,333 --> 02:11:55,666
Saturday is enough.

1817
02:12:04,916 --> 02:12:07,291
Sir, I inquired everywhere.

1818
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:09,125
No complaint has been registered.

1819
02:12:09,458 --> 02:12:11,458
But there was one
complaint at the last station.

1820
02:12:12,583 --> 02:12:14,000
-When?
-Just now.

1821
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:37,416
Sir.

1822
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:44,625
Hey!

1823
02:12:45,375 --> 02:12:46,375
What are you looking at?

1824
02:12:48,625 --> 02:12:49,541
Sir.

1825
02:12:50,583 --> 02:12:51,500
Tell me.

1826
02:12:52,416 --> 02:12:53,333
My name is Surya, sir.

1827
02:12:53,708 --> 02:12:56,458
-A guy hit me. I want to file…
-Who hit you?

1828
02:12:57,625 --> 02:12:58,666
I don't know, sir.

1829
02:12:59,833 --> 02:13:02,583
I don't know.
Sir, sir, sir.

1830
02:13:05,083 --> 02:13:06,625
When? Which day was it?

1831
02:13:07,833 --> 02:13:08,916
Last Saturday, sir.

1832
02:13:09,875 --> 02:13:10,791
Time?

1833
02:13:11,291 --> 02:13:14,750
Around 10:30 p.m. when
I was returning from work.

1834
02:13:14,875 --> 02:13:17,500
-Where do you work?
-NLIC, sir.

1835
02:13:17,666 --> 02:13:18,666
NLIC.

1836
02:13:19,375 --> 02:13:20,958
-Government employee?
-Yes, sir.

1837
02:13:21,625 --> 02:13:22,666
ID?

1838
02:13:25,833 --> 02:13:26,875
Sir.

1839
02:13:30,875 --> 02:13:32,125
-Sudha, check it.
-Sir.

1840
02:13:34,250 --> 02:13:35,333
-Date?
-Check it.

1841
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:38,958
-Sir?
-The date when he hit you.

1842
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,708
The date was…

1843
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,625
Twenty-second…

1844
02:13:48,333 --> 02:13:49,291
What?

1845
02:13:49,541 --> 02:13:50,583
Twenty-second.

1846
02:13:51,041 --> 02:13:52,000
Twenty-second?

1847
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:55,500
Twenty-second?

1848
02:13:56,125 --> 02:13:57,166
Twenty-second?

1849
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:02,958
-Sudha, I got him. Open the cell.
-Sir…

1850
02:14:03,041 --> 02:14:04,041
Hey!

1851
02:14:04,791 --> 02:14:05,666
Open the cell.

1852
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:07,750
Twenty-second is a government holiday.

1853
02:14:07,875 --> 02:14:10,125
-Not a working day.
-Sir, sir, sir.

1854
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:12,750
-Sir, hear me out.
-Get in!

1855
02:14:13,333 --> 02:14:14,625
-Hey!
-Sir, please! No!

1856
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:32,208
Sir, please, sir!

1857
02:14:36,083 --> 02:14:37,125
It's not him.

1858
02:14:37,666 --> 02:14:41,458
I assumed he must've put
his criminal mind to use…

1859
02:14:41,541 --> 02:14:43,916
by hitting me and then
going on to file a complaint.

1860
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,083
All this in the hopes of protecting
himself from me, I thought.

1861
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:51,708
But he's not that smart.

1862
02:14:58,166 --> 02:14:59,041
Su…

1863
02:14:59,125 --> 02:15:00,125
-Surya.
-Surya…

1864
02:15:00,875 --> 02:15:05,708
Was he wearing the mask
or did he force one on you?

1865
02:15:07,041 --> 02:15:08,458
He was wearing the mask, sir.

1866
02:15:08,833 --> 02:15:09,750
How do you know?

1867
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:12,791
How do I know?

1868
02:15:14,541 --> 02:15:15,833
How do I know?

1869
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:20,750
You also got hit.
What are you laughing at, idiot?

1870
02:15:29,333 --> 02:15:31,041
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

1871
02:15:32,375 --> 02:15:35,250
I told you about the petrol
leak at the hospital, sir.

1872
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:37,916
-GH?
-Yes, sir.

1873
02:15:39,833 --> 02:15:42,416
-Sudha, do you remember him?
-Yes, sir.

1874
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:43,666
Then why didn't you say so?

1875
02:15:45,291 --> 02:15:47,666
Surya, thank you.
Come, sit.

1876
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,833
Surya, let's be open.

1877
02:15:52,791 --> 02:15:56,500
-Sir.
-The guy who hit you, him…

1878
02:15:58,666 --> 02:16:00,041
and me…

1879
02:16:01,625 --> 02:16:02,791
is the same person.

1880
02:16:03,208 --> 02:16:04,291
He hit you?!

1881
02:16:04,375 --> 02:16:06,625
Don't be so shocked. That's the truth.

1882
02:16:07,375 --> 02:16:08,875
-Surya.
-Sir.

1883
02:16:09,166 --> 02:16:12,125
Surya, I couldn't see
his face in the dark.

1884
02:16:12,625 --> 02:16:17,041
Did you see anything to help identify him?

1885
02:16:18,375 --> 02:16:20,541
I tried my best to see his face, sir.

1886
02:16:21,958 --> 02:16:23,625
I can recognize his eyes though.

1887
02:16:24,125 --> 02:16:25,166
-Confirm?
-Yes, sir.

1888
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:30,583
Sudha, whoever fits the description
in that age group, get them.

1889
02:16:31,416 --> 02:16:32,958
-We should definitely get him!
-Yes!

1890
02:16:36,125 --> 02:16:41,250
Surya, usually I hit
people without a reason.

1891
02:16:41,708 --> 02:16:43,875
But a guy hit me without reason.

1892
02:16:44,041 --> 02:16:45,000
Will I spare him?

1893
02:16:46,541 --> 02:16:47,916
Wait and watch.

1894
02:16:48,458 --> 02:16:49,583
I will…

1895
02:16:51,458 --> 02:16:55,583
You know what I'll do to
his family in front of his eyes?

1896
02:16:57,791 --> 02:16:58,791
I won't tell you.

1897
02:16:59,625 --> 02:17:02,375
Because I don't know what I'm going to do.

1898
02:17:04,375 --> 02:17:06,041
-Charulatha!
-Sir.

1899
02:17:06,166 --> 02:17:07,416
Take his details.

1900
02:17:08,083 --> 02:17:09,083
Come, Surya.

1901
02:17:09,958 --> 02:17:13,708
I've seen people who don't eat
non-veg or drink on Saturdays.

1902
02:17:14,458 --> 02:17:16,666
What's with hitting and killing people?

1903
02:17:18,333 --> 02:17:19,833
Do you think it's some sort of worship?

1904
02:17:21,958 --> 02:17:24,375
We've identified ten men
in the same age group.

1905
02:17:24,666 --> 02:17:26,125
Call the NLIC guy.

1906
02:17:27,375 --> 02:17:28,333
Sir.

1907
02:17:28,666 --> 02:17:30,916
You took his number, right? Call him!

1908
02:17:38,583 --> 02:17:39,583
No, sir.

1909
02:17:45,125 --> 02:17:46,041
Bottle Cap?

1910
02:17:48,541 --> 02:17:49,541
Why does it say "Bottle Cap"?

1911
02:17:51,875 --> 02:17:55,291
His face looks a little like a bottle cap.

1912
02:18:00,166 --> 02:18:01,625
You don't give it away.

1913
02:18:01,833 --> 02:18:03,500
But you're very naughty.

1914
02:18:08,708 --> 02:18:09,875
Hello.

1915
02:18:11,291 --> 02:18:12,833
Don't say Charu. Don't say Charu.

1916
02:18:15,833 --> 02:18:16,750
Please.

1917
02:18:16,958 --> 02:18:17,916
Hello, Charulatha ma'am.

1918
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:22,541
Brother, Daya here.

1919
02:18:24,166 --> 02:18:25,083
No, sir.

1920
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,666
No, sir.

1921
02:18:39,833 --> 02:18:40,875
Well…

1922
02:18:41,666 --> 02:18:44,375
where was I supposed to be on
the Saturday he tried to kill me?

1923
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:46,541
Delhi, sir.

1924
02:19:09,125 --> 02:19:10,000
Sir.

1925
02:19:13,333 --> 02:19:14,250
We found him!

1926
02:19:25,125 --> 02:19:26,041
Hello.

1927
02:19:26,416 --> 02:19:29,541
I found a guy here.
I have a feeling it's him.

1928
02:19:30,291 --> 02:19:31,333
You found the guy?

1929
02:19:31,625 --> 02:19:32,791
Why? Did you also find the guy?

1930
02:19:33,041 --> 02:19:35,000
I don't know if the guy
you found is the guy.

1931
02:19:35,083 --> 02:19:36,791
But the guy I found is definitely the guy.

1932
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:39,916
-Come, we'll talk.
-Coming, brother.

1933
02:19:42,416 --> 02:19:44,833
Your brother seems to be real fast, sir.

1934
02:19:49,541 --> 02:19:50,708
Come, dear.

1935
02:19:51,291 --> 02:19:52,458
He's the guy.

1936
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:53,916
I'll handle him.

1937
02:20:02,333 --> 02:20:04,250
Hey, Surya!

1938
02:20:04,791 --> 02:20:05,708
What?

1939
02:20:06,208 --> 02:20:07,250
Get up!

1940
02:20:07,333 --> 02:20:08,875
Hey, you know him?

1941
02:20:08,958 --> 02:20:11,125
-Don't be silly, brother.
-No, it's him!

1942
02:20:11,291 --> 02:20:14,250
-It's not him.
-I'm telling you, it's him!

1943
02:20:14,333 --> 02:20:17,916
-Trust me, it's not him.
-Oh, dear! Please believe me.

1944
02:20:18,083 --> 02:20:20,125
I thought really hard
and got hold of him.

1945
02:20:20,458 --> 02:20:22,541
My judgment says he's the guy.

1946
02:20:22,791 --> 02:20:23,666
Foolish judgment.

1947
02:20:24,208 --> 02:20:27,708
He's also a victim of the
Saturday guy just like us.

1948
02:20:28,166 --> 02:20:30,625
In fact, only he has sort of seen him.

1949
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:32,875
We found the actual guy.

1950
02:20:34,041 --> 02:20:35,750
He should take a look and confirm it.

1951
02:20:36,583 --> 02:20:37,458
You found him?

1952
02:20:38,083 --> 02:20:39,625
-Sudha!
-Sir.

1953
02:20:40,416 --> 02:20:41,333
What's this?

1954
02:20:41,958 --> 02:20:42,916
Sorry, Surya.

1955
02:20:44,625 --> 02:20:45,666
Sir, the real guy…

1956
02:20:46,666 --> 02:20:47,625
Take a look.

1957
02:20:47,708 --> 02:20:48,875
What is this?

1958
02:20:52,041 --> 02:20:53,583
He's one of the Sokulapalem guys.

1959
02:20:54,750 --> 02:20:56,000
He wrote a message on the wall.

1960
02:20:59,625 --> 02:21:00,541
Is this him?

1961
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:01,666
Let me go, sir!

1962
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:02,791
No, sir.

1963
02:21:06,166 --> 02:21:07,166
No, sir.

1964
02:21:08,625 --> 02:21:09,708
-Is this him?
-No, sir.

1965
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:11,958
-Is this him?
-No, sir.

1966
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:14,708
Is that him?

1967
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,666
Surya, look properly!

1968
02:21:47,666 --> 02:21:48,583
Kill them!

1969
02:21:51,791 --> 02:21:52,750
Is it him?

1970
02:21:53,250 --> 02:21:54,500
-Is it him?
-No, sir.

1971
02:21:54,625 --> 02:21:55,750
-Is it him?
-No, sir.

1972
02:21:55,958 --> 02:21:57,875
-Surya, look properly!
-No, sir!

1973
02:21:58,458 --> 02:21:59,583
-Tell me!
-Hey!

1974
02:22:00,791 --> 02:22:04,791
Men aged between
20-35 come forward.

1975
02:22:10,958 --> 02:22:11,958
Come on, Surya.

1976
02:22:12,541 --> 02:22:14,875
How can you not identify him now?

1977
02:22:15,875 --> 02:22:17,166
He's supposed to be here, right?

1978
02:22:19,875 --> 02:22:22,541
They're painting his
portrait and celebrating.

1979
02:22:23,125 --> 02:22:24,291
I'm definite he's not among them, sir.

1980
02:22:27,208 --> 02:22:28,416
-Sudha!
-Sir.

1981
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:31,125
-Check who's missing from the list.
-Sir.

1982
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:34,166
Sir, so many of us went
out of town for work.

1983
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:36,375
Went out of town…

1984
02:22:36,458 --> 02:22:37,375
Who all?

1985
02:22:38,083 --> 02:22:41,666
-So many of them.
-I want them all to come back right now!

1986
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:43,166
How can they suddenly…

1987
02:22:43,291 --> 02:22:45,041
-Give us four to five days.
-Hey!

1988
02:22:48,416 --> 02:22:49,541
Two days.

1989
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:52,166
Two days. Yeah.

1990
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:54,291
They should be here in two days.

1991
02:22:55,666 --> 02:22:57,083
Just two days.

1992
02:22:58,625 --> 02:23:01,125
I was worried about your safety
in case I told you I did all this.

1993
02:23:01,375 --> 02:23:03,166
But not telling you
meant risking your lives.

1994
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,083
I don't get it, Dad.

1995
02:23:10,041 --> 02:23:11,541
Forget about us.

1996
02:23:13,458 --> 02:23:14,958
If you tell them that it's you…

1997
02:23:16,625 --> 02:23:19,750
what's the point of
everything you've done so far?

1998
02:23:23,833 --> 02:23:27,333
Even when your uncle abused
your aunt, she'd be meek.

1999
02:23:29,916 --> 02:23:30,958
She feared him.

2000
02:23:31,833 --> 02:23:34,083
The kind of fear the
people of Sokulapalem have.

2001
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:39,583
Your mom had the kind of anger you do now.

2002
02:23:41,541 --> 02:23:42,625
What did she do?

2003
02:23:43,208 --> 02:23:46,333
She assured your aunt that
she could survive on her own.

2004
02:23:47,583 --> 02:23:49,583
She only gave her courage.

2005
02:23:51,583 --> 02:23:52,916
Knowingly or unknowingly…

2006
02:23:54,708 --> 02:23:57,208
you're walking in your mom's footsteps.

2007
02:23:59,375 --> 02:24:01,166
How can you stop halfway now?

2008
02:24:02,083 --> 02:24:04,041
Finish this the way you're meant to.

2009
02:24:12,833 --> 02:24:13,875
Listen.

2010
02:24:14,541 --> 02:24:16,333
I just had an epiphany.

2011
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,875
Maybe these were the last
words your mom wanted to tell you.

2012
02:24:22,208 --> 02:24:23,708
True anger isn't that which…

2013
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:27,083
makes a few people fear you.

2014
02:24:29,041 --> 02:24:30,916
It is that which
empowers a group of people.

2015
02:25:10,750 --> 02:25:11,791
Even he doesn't know.

2016
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,250
He's torturing Surya because he
was there when Daya was beaten.

2017
02:25:15,791 --> 02:25:18,625
Daya will not spare
you till he finds the guy.

2018
02:25:21,541 --> 02:25:23,166
If we want to save ourselves,

2019
02:25:23,541 --> 02:25:25,416
we should find out
who the Saturday guy is.

2020
02:25:26,791 --> 02:25:28,333
Think about how to achieve that.

2021
02:25:28,833 --> 02:25:31,500
Which quality do you
guys have in common?

2022
02:25:31,625 --> 02:25:32,500
Fear?

2023
02:25:36,083 --> 02:25:37,000
Fear.

2024
02:25:37,375 --> 02:25:40,333
Daya is looking for the
scaredy-cat among you.

2025
02:25:40,666 --> 02:25:42,625
The Saturday guy would be
scared because he hit Daya.

2026
02:25:43,083 --> 02:25:44,083
But why are you guys scared?

2027
02:25:44,166 --> 02:25:46,000
So, you being courageous isn't enough.

2028
02:25:46,916 --> 02:25:50,500
Each one of you should be more
courageous than the person beside you.

2029
02:25:50,916 --> 02:25:51,916
That's it!

2030
02:25:52,416 --> 02:25:53,541
Show the same courage.

2031
02:25:54,333 --> 02:25:55,458
The Saturday guy will be found.

2032
02:25:56,125 --> 02:25:58,125
-They'll kill him once they find him.
-Let them!

2033
02:25:58,666 --> 02:25:59,625
What's your problem?

2034
02:26:00,541 --> 02:26:01,833
Why do we care if he dies?

2035
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,041
We'll get him caught, go
inside, and weep like always.

2036
02:26:06,541 --> 02:26:09,000
-Simple, right?
-That was before.

2037
02:26:09,833 --> 02:26:11,833
Now we have mustered some courage.

2038
02:26:12,375 --> 02:26:15,666
It's better to use that courage to
protect him rather than get him caught.

2039
02:26:15,916 --> 02:26:18,750
When the Saturday guy wrote
on the wall for the first time,

2040
02:26:19,416 --> 02:26:21,541
we got hope that it was one
of us who was fighting for us.

2041
02:26:22,791 --> 02:26:24,958
When we got beaten because of him,

2042
02:26:25,208 --> 02:26:26,750
we got angry with him.

2043
02:26:28,541 --> 02:26:30,416
Now, in an attempt to get him caught,

2044
02:26:31,375 --> 02:26:32,666
we got courage as well.

2045
02:26:33,666 --> 02:26:36,166
He brought so many
changes in us unknowingly.

2046
02:26:36,541 --> 02:26:39,291
-Such a guy…
-What do you plan on doing then?

2047
02:26:40,333 --> 02:26:42,375
He took a step forward for all of us.

2048
02:26:42,833 --> 02:26:45,083
Now we'll take a step forward for him.

2049
02:26:48,291 --> 02:26:50,500
He has a big plan if he has
chosen to unite so many people.

2050
02:26:51,291 --> 02:26:52,500
Plan? What plan?

2051
02:26:53,708 --> 02:26:54,875
Mobile data plan.

2052
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,041
What is it, Brother?

2053
02:26:56,833 --> 02:26:58,000
Nothing.

2054
02:26:58,666 --> 02:27:01,458
Something struck me
this morning while praying.

2055
02:27:01,833 --> 02:27:05,125
How do you know that the Saturday
guy tried to kill me at the pub?

2056
02:27:05,875 --> 02:27:08,000
How did you arrive at the right time?

2057
02:27:09,375 --> 02:27:13,500
I've been guarding your
life every second, brother.

2058
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:34,291
And then this guy shows
up and gives me hell.

2059
02:27:34,416 --> 02:27:35,333
Sir!

2060
02:27:37,791 --> 02:27:39,041
-Sudha!
-Sir.

2061
02:27:40,541 --> 02:27:42,208
How come we didn't doubt this?

2062
02:27:44,250 --> 02:27:48,750
How did the Saturday guy
know that we were at the pub?

2063
02:27:49,708 --> 02:27:50,708
Yes, sir.

2064
02:27:51,041 --> 02:27:53,583
In fact, we didn't plan on
going until the last minute.

2065
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,041
Exactly!

2066
02:27:56,875 --> 02:27:58,375
Who else knows about the plan?

2067
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:00,750
The lawyer?

2068
02:28:02,208 --> 02:28:03,583
He's not capable of that.

2069
02:28:06,958 --> 02:28:08,500
Sir, me? No way!

2070
02:28:09,375 --> 02:28:11,250
-Sorry.
-Sir, perfume?

2071
02:28:16,958 --> 02:28:18,541
-Sir.
-You took his number, right?

2072
02:28:18,625 --> 02:28:19,916
Call the NLIC guy.

2073
02:28:23,791 --> 02:28:25,000
Charulatha!

2074
02:28:25,958 --> 02:28:26,916
It's her!

2075
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:33,166
She's helping the Saturday guy.

2076
02:28:34,166 --> 02:28:35,416
What the…

2077
02:28:36,166 --> 02:28:38,791
But, who do you think he is?

2078
02:28:39,708 --> 02:28:41,625
We need to figure out who he is.

2079
02:28:45,833 --> 02:28:46,791
Bottle Cap.

2080
02:28:48,833 --> 02:28:49,708
Bottle Cap!

2081
02:28:51,333 --> 02:28:52,375
Surya!

2082
02:28:54,958 --> 02:28:56,583
He's the Saturday guy.

2083
02:28:57,958 --> 02:28:59,041
Bloody hell!

2084
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:02,083
He was right beside me the whole time.

2085
02:29:04,041 --> 02:29:06,500
My brother's judgment was right, Sudha!

2086
02:29:07,333 --> 02:29:08,250
Brother!

2087
02:29:09,166 --> 02:29:10,208
We found him!

2088
02:29:10,291 --> 02:29:11,833
Your judgment is right!

2089
02:29:11,916 --> 02:29:12,958
It is him!

2090
02:29:14,458 --> 02:29:15,458
You're right.

2091
02:29:16,833 --> 02:29:17,833
We found him.

2092
02:29:19,791 --> 02:29:21,291
But my judgment is wrong.

2093
02:30:00,208 --> 02:30:01,708
-Sir!
-Brother…

2094
02:30:01,958 --> 02:30:03,791
The Saturday guy got away.

2095
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,041
I saw his face.

2096
02:30:05,416 --> 02:30:06,416
It's Surya!

2097
02:30:07,208 --> 02:30:08,666
-Surya?!
-Yes, sir.

2098
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,041
When will Dad be here?

2099
02:30:19,166 --> 02:30:20,625
He'll be here before you go into labor.

2100
02:30:25,166 --> 02:30:26,125
Hello, sir.

2101
02:30:26,708 --> 02:30:27,750
Hello, brother.

2102
02:30:28,375 --> 02:30:30,250
I made you a promise, remember?

2103
02:30:31,208 --> 02:30:34,500
I'll destroy his family in front
of his eyes when I find him.

2104
02:30:35,208 --> 02:30:36,291
I know you remember.

2105
02:30:37,541 --> 02:30:40,041
No more hide and seek.
I found him.

2106
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:43,083
And I started my
streak with his girlfriend.

2107
02:30:45,416 --> 02:30:46,416
Say something.

2108
02:30:46,666 --> 02:30:47,625
Charu?

2109
02:30:50,541 --> 02:30:53,208
Hey, Bottle Cap!
Do you understand?

2110
02:30:53,916 --> 02:30:55,458
Come fast. I'm waiting.

2111
02:30:57,916 --> 02:30:58,791
Surya!

2112
02:31:05,041 --> 02:31:06,083
SATURDAY

2113
02:31:27,541 --> 02:31:28,583
Aunty, Charu…

2114
02:31:29,958 --> 02:31:31,375
Surya…

2115
02:31:36,291 --> 02:31:37,375
Aunty…

2116
02:31:40,708 --> 02:31:41,708
It's me, Chinnu.

2117
02:31:42,875 --> 02:31:43,833
Chinnu?

2118
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:46,666
Chinnu…

2119
02:31:49,041 --> 02:31:51,875
-Aunty…
-I didn't think I'd see you again.

2120
02:31:51,958 --> 02:31:53,125
So Charu is…

2121
02:31:54,583 --> 02:31:55,500
Kallu?

2122
02:31:55,625 --> 02:31:56,625
Kallu!

2123
02:32:04,833 --> 02:32:06,833
My patience has worn out.

2124
02:32:06,958 --> 02:32:09,041
My tears have dried out.

2125
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,041
Understood?

2126
02:32:11,583 --> 02:32:12,500
Come.

2127
02:32:31,083 --> 02:32:32,750
SOKULAPALEM

2128
02:32:40,875 --> 02:32:42,041
Come, come!

2129
02:33:14,708 --> 02:33:15,583
Sudha…

2130
02:33:15,666 --> 02:33:18,541
I took him for an innocent
guy due to his performance.

2131
02:33:18,791 --> 02:33:20,833
But I turned out to be the
innocent one in this story.

2132
02:33:21,250 --> 02:33:22,791
He played me.

2133
02:33:23,791 --> 02:33:26,583
Hey! Show me your performance now.

2134
02:33:26,791 --> 02:33:29,250
Let's see how natural it is.

2135
02:34:13,125 --> 02:34:15,291
You've played a big game.

2136
02:34:18,541 --> 02:34:21,375
REDEMPTION

2137
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:23,166
Seems like she lost a lot of blood.

2138
02:34:24,833 --> 02:34:27,291
She needs to go to the hospital.

2139
02:34:27,708 --> 02:34:28,875
Will you take her?

2140
02:34:30,333 --> 02:34:32,708
But I have a condition.

2141
02:34:35,166 --> 02:34:36,125
See these people?

2142
02:34:37,875 --> 02:34:40,625
If at least one of them…

2143
02:34:41,458 --> 02:34:44,750
opens the door and displays
the courage you gave them…

2144
02:34:45,708 --> 02:34:47,250
I'll personally take her to the hospital.

2145
02:34:48,375 --> 02:34:49,375
Okay?

2146
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:52,375
Get up!

2147
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:54,916
Call them!

2148
02:34:58,166 --> 02:34:59,083
Rajanna…

2149
02:35:00,333 --> 02:35:02,000
If you don't step out now, you never will.

2150
02:35:03,791 --> 02:35:04,750
Laxman!

2151
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:17,625
The courage you wanted
to see isn't here with us.

2152
02:35:17,708 --> 02:35:19,708
Let me show you what fear does!

2153
02:35:23,541 --> 02:35:24,416
Hey!

2154
02:35:24,541 --> 02:35:26,041
Come on out, everyone!

2155
02:35:45,458 --> 02:35:46,833
Why are you standing?

2156
02:35:47,125 --> 02:35:48,583
He'll mistake it for courage.

2157
02:35:49,041 --> 02:35:51,916
Kneel down! Come on!

2158
02:36:02,166 --> 02:36:05,875
I was hoping he'd show
me who the Saturday guy is.

2159
02:36:08,583 --> 02:36:12,458
But instead, I'm telling you
that he's the Saturday guy.

2160
02:36:17,666 --> 02:36:19,958
What's even funnier is,

2161
02:36:20,208 --> 02:36:23,416
he was going to bring out
your courage by hitting me.

2162
02:36:24,125 --> 02:36:25,125
Am I right?

2163
02:36:26,666 --> 02:36:27,708
Come!

2164
02:36:34,458 --> 02:36:36,041
You'll give them courage?

2165
02:36:37,416 --> 02:36:38,458
Answer me!

2166
02:36:53,083 --> 02:36:55,083
-How much?
-Two hundred rupees.

2167
02:36:55,250 --> 02:36:57,291
Two hundred? It's nearby.

2168
02:36:57,500 --> 02:36:58,708
I brought you into the lane, sir.

2169
02:36:59,375 --> 02:37:01,666
Sir, do you have change for 500 rupees?

2170
02:37:04,458 --> 02:37:05,583
I guess he doesn't.

2171
02:37:05,958 --> 02:37:08,500
Alright. Keep this.

2172
02:37:23,958 --> 02:37:25,125
It's Kallu, Dad.

2173
02:37:32,083 --> 02:37:33,083
What?

2174
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:49,583
Sit down, sir.

2175
02:37:50,416 --> 02:37:51,333
Sit down, sir.

2176
02:37:51,458 --> 02:37:53,041
You might not be able to sit again.

2177
02:37:57,333 --> 02:37:58,208
Sudha…

2178
02:37:58,916 --> 02:38:02,041
He's losing his shit
watching his son like this.

2179
02:38:02,875 --> 02:38:03,750
No, sir.

2180
02:38:04,583 --> 02:38:06,291
He and I, we're used to this.

2181
02:38:08,041 --> 02:38:09,000
Come.

2182
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,750
You just met him.

2183
02:38:14,041 --> 02:38:15,875
You need to know who he is as a person.

2184
02:38:16,583 --> 02:38:20,916
He's not the type to project
his anger on someone else.

2185
02:38:21,250 --> 02:38:23,125
From the moment he feels anger,

2186
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:26,625
he writes down the person's
name, introspects his anger,

2187
02:38:26,708 --> 02:38:28,708
and if he still feels that
his anger is justified,

2188
02:38:29,708 --> 02:38:31,875
he schedules that person's
wrath for that Saturday.

2189
02:38:32,708 --> 02:38:34,125
No matter who it is.

2190
02:38:35,416 --> 02:38:37,541
In fact, he was angry at you as well.

2191
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:42,541
The first time, when he was
going to write your name down,

2192
02:38:42,625 --> 02:38:43,541
Charu…

2193
02:38:45,958 --> 02:38:47,375
He stopped because of her thought.

2194
02:38:48,125 --> 02:38:49,083
You got saved.

2195
02:38:53,458 --> 02:38:55,458
He wrote your name down the second time.

2196
02:38:56,958 --> 02:38:57,833
But, I…

2197
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,833
I gave him sleeping pills and stopped him.

2198
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:01,416
I kind of saved you.

2199
02:39:03,125 --> 02:39:06,416
Killing all chances of ever
writing your name down again…

2200
02:39:07,041 --> 02:39:10,916
my daughter made him promise
to quit these Saturday fights.

2201
02:39:11,166 --> 02:39:12,458
She completely saved you.

2202
02:39:14,375 --> 02:39:16,708
You owe your life to our family, sir.

2203
02:39:17,166 --> 02:39:19,750
For saving you from this beast.

2204
02:39:26,291 --> 02:39:31,416
So, I'm alive today because
of the promise he made to his sister?

2205
02:39:32,791 --> 02:39:37,750
Sudha, it's funny how I got out alive
so many times without my involvement.

2206
02:39:38,625 --> 02:39:41,291
Something else also happened
without your involvement.

2207
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:45,375
Surya.

2208
02:39:47,333 --> 02:39:49,458
Remember what Mom used to say?

2209
02:39:52,083 --> 02:39:55,625
"The day your anger is truly
justified, I won't say a word."

2210
02:39:57,833 --> 02:39:59,583
Dad told me everything.

2211
02:40:02,625 --> 02:40:03,916
Today is your day.

2212
02:40:05,458 --> 02:40:06,750
I won't say a word.

2213
02:40:11,833 --> 02:40:14,250
She gave you permission.
What are you waiting for?

2214
02:40:14,625 --> 02:40:16,583
That's what I don't understand, sir.

2215
02:40:17,458 --> 02:40:20,125
When he decides to
hit a guy every Saturday…

2216
02:40:20,916 --> 02:40:23,458
I go to them and warn them beforehand.

2217
02:40:25,083 --> 02:40:28,458
Similarly, I came to warn you.

2218
02:40:28,916 --> 02:40:31,166
But here, he's on the floor.

2219
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,208
I called him a beast before.

2220
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:36,916
No, sir.

2221
02:40:37,958 --> 02:40:39,375
He's a changed man.

2222
02:40:41,458 --> 02:40:45,958
There's no place he hasn't
looked for his aunt and Kallu.

2223
02:40:46,875 --> 02:40:48,875
Kallu is the love of his life.

2224
02:40:49,375 --> 02:40:51,541
They're the lives his mother
has preciously guarded.

2225
02:40:52,291 --> 02:40:56,333
Despite that, when you touched
Kallu, my daughter-in-law,

2226
02:40:56,458 --> 02:40:58,333
he calmed his anger down,

2227
02:40:58,416 --> 02:41:03,166
waiting for their lives to change,
for them to muster courage.

2228
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:04,708
He's a changed man, sir.

2229
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:09,333
You're one lucky man, sir.

2230
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,958
Look.

2231
02:41:11,375 --> 02:41:15,000
The people of Sokulapalem
are protecting you now.

2232
02:41:18,291 --> 02:41:19,625
By chance of luck,

2233
02:41:19,958 --> 02:41:25,000
even if one of them musters the
courage and takes a step forward…

2234
02:41:28,625 --> 02:41:31,250
you've only seen his two
eyes at the pub that day.

2235
02:41:32,875 --> 02:41:34,750
You'll see his third eye now.

2236
02:41:36,291 --> 02:41:37,750
It's going to be Shiva Tandavam.

2237
02:41:46,666 --> 02:41:51,041
So, if I want to see the
Saturday guy you're talking about…

2238
02:41:52,041 --> 02:41:55,708
one of them has to
courageously step forward?

2239
02:41:55,791 --> 02:41:56,666
Yes, sir.

2240
02:42:00,208 --> 02:42:02,666
These fools aren't coming
forward no matter what I do.

2241
02:42:04,541 --> 02:42:05,541
What should I do?

2242
02:42:05,625 --> 02:42:06,791
What should I do?

2243
02:42:14,666 --> 02:42:17,375
Sir, please let her go.

2244
02:42:17,458 --> 02:42:20,041
She's a little girl.
Please let her go.

2245
02:42:20,125 --> 02:42:22,291
Sir, let her go! Please!

2246
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:28,500
Sir, please let her go.

2247
02:42:29,083 --> 02:42:31,541
If I kill this little girl…

2248
02:42:31,916 --> 02:42:33,083
would that be enough?

2249
02:42:52,708 --> 02:42:54,000
Keep them coming!

2250
02:42:54,083 --> 02:42:55,333
This is not enough!

2251
02:42:55,416 --> 02:42:56,458
This is not enough!

2252
02:43:31,083 --> 02:43:32,791
That's enough!

2253
02:44:09,083 --> 02:44:12,250
He, the one who breaks
The shackles of doubt

2254
02:44:12,458 --> 02:44:14,791
With a fierce and intense gaze

2255
02:44:14,916 --> 02:44:17,333
His nails are like blazing
Flames on a mountain

2256
02:44:17,666 --> 02:44:20,583
He is the constant force
Of balance on a Saturday

2257
02:44:32,125 --> 02:44:34,833
The battlefield is ready for war

2258
02:44:34,916 --> 02:44:37,500
Let the conch shells echo in the air

2259
02:44:37,583 --> 02:44:40,125
Even your eyes launch weapons

2260
02:44:40,208 --> 02:44:42,916
Your blood boils with the fuel of breath

2261
02:44:54,416 --> 02:44:57,208
The warrior of ferocity burns wild

2262
02:44:57,291 --> 02:44:59,666
The war bells ring with an echo

2263
02:44:59,791 --> 02:45:02,333
There is fire flaring up all around

2264
02:45:02,416 --> 02:45:05,041
It is going to be Shiva Tandavam

2265
02:45:10,458 --> 02:45:13,208
The warrior of ferocity burns wild

2266
02:45:13,291 --> 02:45:15,875
The war bells ring with an echo

2267
02:45:15,958 --> 02:45:18,416
There is fire flaring up all around

2268
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:21,458
It is going to be Shiva Tandavam

2269
02:45:39,625 --> 02:45:40,708
You guys go, ma'am!

2270
02:46:59,875 --> 02:47:03,625
You can't leave without telling
me how the performance was!

2271
02:47:09,458 --> 02:47:10,625
Oh, no!

2272
02:47:14,583 --> 02:47:16,083
You need to go to the hospital.

2273
02:47:17,416 --> 02:47:18,375
Will you go?

2274
02:47:19,541 --> 02:47:20,833
But I have one condition.

2275
02:47:21,875 --> 02:47:25,166
If at least one of them…

2276
02:47:26,125 --> 02:47:28,291
comes forward and says…

2277
02:47:28,375 --> 02:47:30,708
"Poor guy, Surya! Let him go."

2278
02:47:31,666 --> 02:47:33,875
I'll personally take you to the hospital.

2279
02:47:35,833 --> 02:47:36,750
Okay?

2280
02:47:38,416 --> 02:47:40,416
Go ahead. Ask!

2281
02:47:53,541 --> 02:47:56,583
There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

2282
02:47:57,250 --> 02:47:58,791
He used to trouble people a lot.

2283
02:47:59,208 --> 02:48:02,416
So Sri Krishna teamed up with Satyabhama…

2284
02:48:03,083 --> 02:48:04,333
and killed him.

2285
02:48:06,166 --> 02:48:07,541
Those were the olden days.

2286
02:48:08,958 --> 02:48:09,875
Back then.

2287
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,125
These are modern times.

2288
02:48:13,583 --> 02:48:16,625
We can't keep waiting for
new avatars and heroes.

2289
02:48:17,583 --> 02:48:18,708
We should stand up for ourselves.

2290
02:48:20,333 --> 02:48:21,458
Mankind should help each other.

2291
02:48:23,416 --> 02:48:25,208
We have to be there for one another.

2292
02:48:27,291 --> 02:48:28,791
No matter who the opposite person is.

2293
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:06,125
There's action in my life.

2294
02:49:06,916 --> 02:49:09,291
There's emotion and suspense.

2295
02:49:10,041 --> 02:49:11,208
There's everything, in fact.

2296
02:49:12,333 --> 02:49:14,916
Except for romance.

2297
02:49:18,708 --> 02:49:20,083
You've known me for a while.

2298
02:49:21,208 --> 02:49:23,041
Didn't you ever have feelings for me?

2299
02:49:28,916 --> 02:49:31,166
For your "Bottle Cap" face?

2300
02:49:33,041 --> 02:49:35,125
-Surya…
-Yes, Dad!

2301
02:49:37,708 --> 02:49:40,208
Your "Scooty Pep" face got
lucky with this "Bottle Cap."

2302
02:49:43,166 --> 02:49:44,041
Nani.

2303
02:49:47,458 --> 02:49:48,500
Did you call me, Samantha?

2304
02:49:51,291 --> 02:49:54,125
I'm feeling like you're calling me,
even though you aren't.

2305
02:49:55,250 --> 02:49:57,125
I can imagine how special I am to you.

2306
02:50:07,958 --> 02:50:09,958
You said your mom was going to
be reborn as your sister's daughter.

2307
02:50:10,333 --> 02:50:11,500
We're forever in agreement now.

2308
02:50:11,916 --> 02:50:13,166
We'll abide by whatever your mom says.

2309
02:50:51,708 --> 02:50:53,000
I got angry.

2310
02:50:54,208 --> 02:50:55,916
And once I get angry,

2311
02:50:56,541 --> 02:50:57,500
they become my family.

2312
02:50:57,916 --> 02:50:59,000
And this becomes my problem.

2313
02:51:39,458 --> 02:51:40,500
I won't spare them.

2314
02:51:41,166 --> 02:51:42,333
I won't spare any of them.
